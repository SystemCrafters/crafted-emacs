#+title: Rational Emacs

A sensible starting point for hacking your own Emacs configuration.

*Please note*: =rational-emacs= is under active development. While the intent
of this project is to provide a stable Emacs configuration for use by
anyone, it is not yet stable enough for everyday or production use.  The
rapid pace of changes could cause your configuration to break on your next
pull of the repository. If you are not expecting or prepared to encounter
such issues, we would recommend you wait for things to stabilize a bit
before using.

* Quick Start

Install emacs >= 27.2 from your distribution's repositories.

Clone this repository to =~/.emacs.d= or =~/.config/emacs=:

#+caption: Command to clone System Crafters Rational Emacs =git= repository.
#+name: li#git_clone
#+begin_src sh

  git clone https://github.com/SystemCrafters/rational-emacs ~/.config/emacs

#+end_src

This will set up the minimal configuration. If you'd like a more
fully-configured experience, copy the example-config.el to
=~/.rational-emacs/config.el= and restart Emacs.

* Principles

This configuration and all associated modules intend to follow the below
priniciples.

*NOTE:* Some of these may change over time as we learn from this process.

** Minimal, modular configuration

The core configuration only sets up Emacs to have a cleaner presentation with
sensible defaults. It is up to the user to decide which of the various
=rational-*= modules to load and when to load them.

Configuration modules should depend on other modules and the base configuration
as little as possible. When a configuration module needs to integrate with other
functionality in Emacs, the standard extensibility points of each package should
be used (instead of expecting our own configuration module).

The implication is that someone should be able to install or copy code from a
=rational-*= module into their own configuration /without/ using Rational Emacs.

** Prioritize built-in Emacs functionality

Where possible, we will leverage built-in Emacs functionality instead of
external packages, for example:

- =project.el= instead of =Projectile=
- =tab-bar-mode= instead of =Perspective.el=, =persp-mode=, =eyebrowse=, etc
- =eglot= instead of =lsp-mode= (because =eglot= prioritizes built-in
  functionality)
- *Possibly* =vc-mode= by default

** Works well in the terminal

Some people prefer to use Emacs in the terminal instead of as a graphical
program. This configuration should work well in this case too! This also enables
the use of Emacs in Termux on Android.

** Can be integrated with a Guix configuration

It should be possible to customize aspects of the Rational Emacs configuration
inside of a Guix Home configuration so that things like font sizes, themes, etc
can be system-specific.

It can also use packages installed via the Guix package manager instead of
=package.el=.

** Works well with =Chemacs2=

=Chemacs2= is an excellent tool for enabling the use of multiple Emacs
configurations simultaneously. This configuration will behave well when used
with =Chemacs2= so that users can try and use different Emacs configurations as
needed.

** Helps you learn Emacs Lisp

Instead of providing a higher-level configuration system out of the box like
other Emacs configurations, we follow standard Emacs Lisp patterns so that you
can learn by reading the configuration.

* Why use it?

Why choose this configuration over /Doom Emacs/, /Spacemacs/, /Prelude/, or
others?

The goal of this configuration is to make it easier to write your own Emacs
configuration while using pre-made configuration parts maintained by the
community. Instead of using a monolithic, all-encompassing approach, we strive
to ensure that all parts of this configuration are optional or interchangeable.

You should even be able to use the configuration modules we provide with your
own =init.el= file without using this base configuration repo!

* Modules

Here is a list of the built-in modules that you may load. They are located in
directory =$RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME/modules=, which are in the directory your =git=
clone from listing [[li#git_clone]]. Follow the links to each to get more
information about how they can be configured!

- [[file:modules/rational-defaults.el][rational-defaults]] :: Sensible default settings for Emacs
- [[file:modules/rational-ui.el][rational-ui]] :: Extra UI configuration for a better experience (mode line, etc)
- [[file:modules/rational-completion.el][rational-completion]] :: A better selection framework configuration based on
  =Vertico=
- [[file:modules/rational-evil.el][rational-evil]] :: An =evil-mode= configuration
- [[file:modules/rational-windows.el][rational-windows]] :: Window management configuration
- [[file:modules/rational-use-package.el][rational-use-package]] :: Configuration for =use-package= 

Modules that we will be adding in the future:

- rational-desktop :: A desktop environment centered around =EXWM=
- rational-present :: Tools for giving presentations
- rational-screencast :: Tools for doing screencasts
- rational-workspace :: An improved workspace experience based on =tab-bar-mode=
- rational-shell :: A starter configuration for =eshell= and =vterm=

* Customization

To add your own customization to this configuration, create a configuraton file
in one of the following places:

- =~/.rational-emacs/config.el=
- =~/.config/rational-emacs/config.el=

In your configuration you can set any Emacs configuration variable, face
attributes, themes, etc as you normally would.

If you prefer to explicitly control where your =config.el= and =early-config.el=
are found for Rational Emacs, you may provide a value for the
=RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME= environment variable, either on the command line or in
your shell configuration. This variable should only contain the path to the
=config.el= files, for example:

#+caption: Set environment variable =RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME= to the path of the configuration directory.
#+begin_src shell
  RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME=~/my-rational-emacs-config
#+end_src

** How the rational config file is found

The rational config files (=config.el= and =early-config.el=) are found in the
=rational-config-path=. That path will match exactly one of the following
scenarios, in the order specified:

- Using =Chemacs2= (See below for more on this)
  - The environment variable =RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME= is used if provided in the
    profile definition.
  - The =rational-emacs= subdirectory of the profile is used when no environment
    variable is provided in the profile definition.
- Use the value found in the =RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME= environment variable.
- The environment variable =XDG_CONFIG_HOME= is present or the path
  =$HOME/.config/rational-emacs= exists.
  - These normally resolve to the same file, so build the path from the
    =XDG_CONFIG_HOME= environment variable or the explicit path
    =~/.config/rational-emacs=
- Use the =HOME= environment variable to make the path, which expands to
  =$HOME/.rational-emacs=.

Once the =rational-config-path= is determined, if it does not exist in the
filesystem, it is created. However, just the path is created, the files
=config.el= and =early-config.el= must be created by you.

** Example Configuration:

#+caption: Example of user created Rational Emacs =config.el= file.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'rational-defaults)
  (require 'rational-screencast)
  (require 'rational-ui)
  (require 'rational-editing)
  (require 'rational-evil)
  (require 'rational-completion)
  (require 'rational-windows)

  ;; Set further font and theme customizations
  (custom-set-variables
   '(rational-ui-default-font
     '(:font "JetBrains Mono" :weight light :height 185)))

  (load-theme 'doom-snazzy t)

  ;; To not load `custom.el' after `config.el', uncomment this line.
  ;; (setq rational-load-custom-file nil)
#+end_src

** The =custom.el= file

   The =custom.el= file will hold the auto-generated code from the Emacs
   Customization UI, and other packages that similarly add code to the variables
   and faces form in the =init.el= file.

*** Simplified overview of how Emacs Customization works

    Customizable values are defined with the =defcustom= form, and can be
    customized using the Easy Customization UI. A complete discussion is out of
    scope for this document, instead see the Emacs Manual for more information.

    There are several states a value can be in, for our purposes, we will only
    consider two of them: the default state and the changed state. These are not
    the "official" names but easily convey the concepts of the variable. If a
    value is in the default state, looking in the Customization UI, the state
    will be listed as =STANDARD=. Rational Emacs takes the approach of using the
    =customize-set-variable= to update the values defined with
    =defcustom=. This will show the values as =SET for current session only= in
    the Customization UI. This is normal since the values are set each time
    emacs starts. They are technically "SAVED" since they exist as emacs-lisp
    code, but since they are not in a =custom-set-variables= form the
    Customization UI only sees them as "SET for the current session only".

    A =SAVED and set= value means the Customization code has written the
    configuration to disk to be loaded again the next time Emacs starts. When
    Emacs saves the configuration from the Customization UI, it simply adds a
    couple of forms to the end of your initialization file (typically
    =init.el=), with comments warning about having more than one form with the
    same name:

    #+name: custom.el
    #+caption: Example =custom.el= file contents.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (custom-set-variables
       ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
       ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
       ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
       ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
       '(rational-ui-default-font '(:font "JetBrains Mono" :weight light :height 185))
       '(rational-ui-display-line-numbers t))
      (custom-set-faces
       ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
       ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
       ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
       ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
       )
    #+end_src


*** Loading the =custom.el= file

    When ~rational-load-custom-file~ is non-nil (the default), the =custom.el= 
    file is loaded /after/ the initialization process, including after the user
    =config.el= is loaded. 

    The customization variable values (as set in =init.el= with
    =customize-set-variables=) are in the =SET for current session only= state,
    unless altered by a saved customization loaded from =custom.el=. Any values
    set through the Customization UI or other work flows, for example by using
    the =org-agenda-to-front= or =org-remove-file= functions, which write to the
    =custom-set-variables= form, are preserved in the =custom.el= file if they are
    saved for future sessions (as by the Customization UI widget, or by code).

*** Not loading the =custom.el= file

    To not load the =custom file=, change the value for the
    ~rational-load-custom-file~  to =nil= in your =config.el=.

    Using =customize-set-variable= in Emacs Lisp has the same effect as using
    the Customization UI, except the customization is not saved to =custom.el=
    as if you had used the Customization UI *and* used the widget to save the
    customizations for future sessions.

    If you choose to follow this pattern, customizing variables in your
    =config.el= only (not using the UI) then you may never need to load
    =custom.el=. However, there are some caveats: using certain work flows with
    Org Agenda files or risky variables in =.dir-locals.el= which write to the
    =custom.el= file will never be applied, even though they are saved in the
    custom file.

* Using it with =Chemacs2=

If you have the =Chemacs2= configuration cloned to =~/.emacs.d= or
=~/.config/emacs=, you can clone =rational-emacs= anywhere you like and add an
entry to it in your =~/.emacs-profiles.el= file:

You can then put your =early-config.el= and =config.el= files in the subfolder
=~/path/to/rational-emacs/rational-emacs=. So, for example if you installed
Rational Emacs to =~/.rational-emacs=, then your =early-config.el= and
=config.el= files would be in the path =~/.rational-emacs/rational-emacs=. This
is the default path, but you can change the name to something else, see below
for examples.

#+caption: Example of a =Chemacs2= user profile file in =~/.emacs-profiles.el=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (("rational" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/path/to/rational-emacs"))))

#+end_src

If you prefer to put your Rational Emacs customizations elsewhere (for example
in a folder called `config` or maybe `personal`), you can specify the
=RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME= environment variable, for example like this:

#+caption: User =Chemacs2= profile file =~/.emacs-profiles.el= with environment variable.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (("rational" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/path/to/rational-emacs")
                    (env . (("RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME" . "~/path/to/rational-emacs/personal"))))))

#+end_src

Or some place completely different:

#+caption: User =Chemacs2= profile file =~/.emacs-profiles.el= with Rational Emacs config files set to another path.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (("rational" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/path/to/rational-emacs")
                    (env . (("RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME" . "~/rational-config/personal"))))))

#+end_src


Then launch it with =emacs --with-profile rational=!
