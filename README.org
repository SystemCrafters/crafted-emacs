#+title: Crafted Emacs

A sensible starting point for hacking your own Emacs configuration.

*Please note*: =crafted-emacs= is under active development.  The pace of
development may be slow or fast depending on issues and pull requests
submitted.  This is a community project, so the pace will depend largely on the
needs of the community.  We would encourage you to try using this configuration,
especially if you enjoy tinkering a bit on getting Emacs to work "just
right"(tm) for you. 

* !!! Major changes coming !!!

Crafted Emacs is going through a fairly major update which may (or will!) be
disruptive to most users.  This is an early notification of the changes coming. 
The changes will be made on a branch and which will be published later (watch this 
space, reddit #planetemacs, and/or emacs.ch/@wolfjb for announcements)

For an early preview of the changes coming see my [[https://write.as/jeffbowman/crafted-emacs-update-for-january-2023-a-new-direction][blog post]].

* Transition from an existing Rational Emacs configuration

This project was originally called _Rational Emacs_. However, we chose to rename
to _Crafted Emacs_ to better represent our ideas and fit better with the System
Crafters goals and messaging.

If you were previously using *rational-emacs*, please follow the instructions
[[#transitioning-from-rational-emacs-to-crafted-emacs][below]].

* Quick Start

Install emacs >= 27.2 from your distribution's repositories.

Clone this repository to =~/.emacs.d= or =~/.config/emacs=:

#+caption: Command to clone System Crafters Crafted Emacs =git= repository.
#+name: li#git_clone
#+begin_src sh

  git clone https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs ~/.config/emacs

#+end_src

This will set up the minimal configuration. If you'd like a more
fully-configured experience, see [[#customization][Customization]].

* What is Crafted Emacs?

Crafted Emacs is an attempt to simplify creating a configuration for Emacs.  It
is not necessarily intended to provide all possible configuration for every
eventuality.  We do envision it being a nice baseline for users who want to
create their own Emacs configuration.  As a user develops their skill with Emacs
Lisp and configuring Emacs in general, we anticipate such a person may end up
rewriting their configuration to the point they are no longer using Crafted
Emacs.  This is an exciting possibility to us, and a journey worth taking!

We try to follow these goals:

+ No new configuration system, macros, layers etc.  Almost everything is straight
  Emacs Lisp.  The one place we have macros is currently is the packaging system
  to provide a simple consistent interface regardless of the packaging system
  the user chooses (currently, either the built-in =package.el= or =straight.el=
  for those who prefer a more functional approach to package management).
+ Provide some pre-configured modules to shorten the time it takes to build a
  nice working configuration.
+ Customizations in the modules we provide should be _opt-in_ by default to
  avoid surprising behavior.
+ Not a turn-key/kitchen sink solution. There will be holes the user is expected
  to fill.
+ Fewer packages rather than more; we prefer to stay closer to built-in
  functionality as much as possible.
+ Correctness is important, as we expect people who might be new to Emacs Lisp
  to learn from what we have written.  We prefer =customize-set-variable=
  instead of =setq= for =defcustom= values as an example.
+ Documentation is thorough, complete, and easy to find.  There is an [[info:crafted-emacs][info]]
  manual for Crafted Emacs distributed with the source.

These goals are based on the [[#Principles][Principles]] listed below.

For more on the vision of this project, see [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/192][this]] issue.

** Principles

This configuration and all associated modules intend to follow the below
principles.

*NOTE:* Some of these may change over time as we learn from this process.

*** Minimal, modular configuration

The core configuration only sets up Emacs to have a cleaner presentation with
sensible defaults. It is up to the user to decide which of the various
=crafted-*= modules to load and when to load them.

Configuration modules should depend on other modules and the base configuration
as little as possible. When a configuration module needs to integrate with other
functionality in Emacs, the standard extensibility points of each package should
be used (instead of expecting our own configuration module).

The implication is that someone should be able to install or copy code from a
=crafted-*= module into their own configuration /without/ using Crafted Emacs.

*** Prioritize built-in Emacs functionality

Where possible, we will leverage built-in Emacs functionality instead of
external packages, for example:

- =project.el= instead of =Projectile=
- =tab-bar-mode= instead of =Perspective.el=, =persp-mode=, =eyebrowse=, etc
- =eglot= instead of =lsp-mode= (because =eglot= prioritizes built-in
  functionality)
- *Possibly* =vc-mode= by default

*** Sensible folder layout

While Emacs tends to keep everything (code, configuration, state files, ...)
inside `user-emacs-directory` modern computer systems tend to keep those
separated.

Crafted Emacs tries to maintain some balance between those two paradigms by
bringing just the right amount of order to it.

See [[file:docs/crafted-emacs.org#folder-structure][Folder structure]] in the documentation for more details.

*** Works well in the terminal

Some people prefer to use Emacs in the terminal instead of as a graphical
program. This configuration should work well in this case too! This also enables
the use of Emacs in Termux on Android.

*** Can be integrated with a Guix configuration

It should be possible to customize aspects of the Crafted Emacs configuration
inside of a Guix Home configuration so that things like font sizes, themes, etc
can be system-specific.

It can also use packages installed via the Guix package manager instead of
=package.el=.

*** Works well with =Chemacs2=

=Chemacs2= is an excellent tool for enabling the use of multiple Emacs
configurations simultaneously. This configuration will behave well when used
with =Chemacs2= so that users can try and use different Emacs configurations as
needed.

*** Helps you learn Emacs Lisp

Instead of providing a higher-level configuration system out of the box like
other Emacs configurations, we follow standard Emacs Lisp patterns so that you
can learn by reading the configuration.

*** Reversible

   Not everyone will agree with our decisions, so each customization should be
   easily reversible in the users =config.el= file.

* Why use it?

Why choose this configuration over /Doom Emacs/, /Spacemacs/, /Prelude/, or
others?

The goal of this configuration is to make it easier to write your own Emacs
configuration while using pre-made configuration parts maintained by the
community. Instead of using a monolithic, all-encompassing approach, we strive
to ensure that all parts of this configuration are optional or interchangeable.

You should even be able to use the configuration modules we provide with your
own =init.el= file without using this base configuration repo!

* Modules

Here is a list of the built-in modules that you may load. They are located in
directory =$CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME/modules=, which are in the directory your =git=
clone from listing [[li#git_clone]]. Follow the links to each to get more

* Customization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: customization
:END:

To add your own customization to this configuration, create a configuration file
in one of the following directories:

- =~/.crafted-emacs/=
- =~/.config/crafted-emacs/=

Crafted Emacs looks out for two configuration files in one of those places:

1. =config.el= – General configuration. Here you can set any Emacs configuration
   variables, face attributes, themes, etc. In short: anything that would
   normally go into =init.el= goes here.
2. =early-config.el= – Configuration that needs to happen early during Emacs
   startup (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html]["The Early Init File"]] in the Emacs Manual for details), like
   customizing the process of initializing the package system etc. In short:
   anything, that would normally go into =early-init.el= goes here.

If you prefer to explicitly control where your =config.el= and =early-config.el=
are found for Crafted Emacs, you may provide a value for the
=CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME= environment variable, either on the command line or in
your shell configuration. This variable should only contain the path to the
=config.el= files, for example:

#+caption: Set environment variable =CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME= to the path of the configuration directory.
#+begin_src shell
  CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME=~/my-crafted-emacs-config
#+end_src

** How the crafted config file is found

The crafted config files (=config.el= and =early-config.el=) are found in the
=crafted-config-path=. That path will match exactly one of the following
scenarios, in the order specified:

- Using =Chemacs2= (See below for more on this)
  - The environment variable =CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME= is used if provided in the
    profile definition.
  - The =crafted-emacs= subdirectory of the profile is used when no environment
    variable is provided in the profile definition.
- Use the value found in the =CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME= environment variable.
- The environment variable =XDG_CONFIG_HOME= is present or the path
  =$HOME/.config/crafted-emacs= exists.
  - These normally resolve to the same file, so build the path from the
    =XDG_CONFIG_HOME= environment variable or the explicit path
    =~/.config/crafted-emacs=
- Use the =HOME= environment variable to make the path, which expands to
  =$HOME/.crafted-emacs=.

Once the =crafted-config-path= is determined, if it does not exist in the
filesystem, it is created. However, just the path is created, the files
=config.el= and =early-config.el= must be created by you.

** Example Configuration:

To make use of the sensible defaults that Crafted Emacs aims to provide,
the first thing in your user configuration is to choose, which of the modules
you want to use.

Let's say for example, you want to have a look at all the modules, but you
don't want to use =evil-mode= and you have no use for the screencasting module.
Also, you need the advanced project management features of projectile, so you
don't want built-in project management either. In that case, your example
config might begin like this:

#+caption: Example of basic Crafted Emacs =config.el= file.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'crafted-defaults)    ; Sensible default settings for Emacs
  (require 'crafted-updates)     ; Tools to upgrade Crafted Emacs
  (require 'crafted-completion)  ; selection framework based on `vertico`
  (require 'crafted-ui)          ; Better UI experience (modeline etc.)
  (require 'crafted-windows)     ; Window management configuration
  (require 'crafted-editing)     ; Whitespace trimming, auto parens etc.
  ;(require 'crafted-evil)        ; An `evil-mode` configuration
  (require 'crafted-org)         ; org-appear, clickable hyperlinks etc.
  ;(require 'crafted-project)     ; built-in alternative to projectile
  (require 'crafted-speedbar)    ; built-in file-tree
  ;(require 'crafted-screencast)  ; show current command and binding in modeline

  ;; Further settings and customizations follow here...
  ;; ...
#+end_src

More detailed example config files can be found in the folder =examples=.

** The =custom-modules= folder

   This folder is where you can provide your own modules.  As an example, you
   can copy one of the crafted modules to this folder and then change it for
   your needs.  This folder is listed in the =load-path= before the crafted
   modules path, so modules here will be loaded first.

   For example, if you prefer =selectrum= instead of =vertico=, you might copy
   the =crafted-completion= module to the =custom-modules= folder. Then you
   might replace the configuration for =vertico= with a configuration you prefer
   for =selectrum=.  Then in your =config.el= you would still have =(require
   'crafted-completion)= but the version from your =custom-modules= folder will
   be loaded.  Names do not have to be the same as a module name listed above.
   You may choose to name your modules whatever makes sense to you.  One
   advantage to /not/ naming your modules the same as a crafted module, you can
   still require the crafted module in your own module. To follow the above
   example, if you had named your module =my-completion.el= you might end up
   with the following code:

   #+name: my-completion.el
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require 'crafted-completion)
     (vertico-mode -1)                       ; turn off vertico

     (crafted-package-install-package 'prescient)
     (crafted-package-install-package 'selectrum)
     (crafted-package-install-package 'selectrum-prescient)

     (customize-set-variable 'prescient-save-file
                             (expand-file-name "prescient-save.el" crafted-config-var-directory))

     
     ;;; Selectrum
     (require 'selectrum)
     (require 'selectrum-prescient)
     (customize-set-variable 'selectrum-highlight-candidates-function
                             #'orderless-highlight-matches)
     (customize-set-variable 'orderless-skip-highlighting (lambda () selectrum-is-active))
     (selectrum-mode +1)                     ; use selectrum

     ;; use this to layer prescient with orderless
     ;; see: https://github.com/radian-software/selectrum
     (customize-set-variable 'selectrum-prescient-enable-filtering nil)
     (selectrum-prescient-mode +1)
     (prescient-persist-mode +1)
   #+end_src

** The =custom.el= file

   The =custom.el= file will hold the auto-generated code from the Emacs
   Customization UI, and other packages that similarly add code to the variables
   and faces form in the =init.el= file.

*** Simplified overview of how Emacs Customization works

    Customizable values are defined with the =defcustom= form, and can be
    customized using the Easy Customization UI. A complete discussion is out of
    scope for this document, instead see the Emacs Manual for more information.

    There are several states a value can be in, for our purposes, we will only
    consider two of them: the default state and the changed state. These are not
    the "official" names but easily convey the concepts of the variable. If a
    value is in the default state, looking in the Customization UI, the state
    will be listed as =STANDARD=. Crafted Emacs takes the approach of using the
    =customize-set-variable= to update the values defined with
    =defcustom=. This will show the values as =SET for current session only= in
    the Customization UI. This is normal since the values are set each time
    emacs starts. They are technically "SAVED" since they exist as emacs-lisp
    code, but since they are not in a =custom-set-variables= form the
    Customization UI only sees them as "SET for the current session only".

    A =SAVED and set= value means the Customization code has written the
    configuration to disk to be loaded again the next time Emacs starts. When
    Emacs saves the configuration from the Customization UI, it simply adds a
    couple of forms to the end of your initialization file (typically
    =init.el=), with comments warning about having more than one form with the
    same name:

    #+name: custom.el
    #+caption: Example =custom.el= file contents.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (custom-set-variables
       ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
       ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
       ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
       ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
       '(crafted-ui-default-font '(:font "JetBrains Mono" :weight light :height 185))
       '(crafted-ui-display-line-numbers t))
      (custom-set-faces
       ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
       ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
       ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
       ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
       )
    #+end_src


*** Loading the =custom.el= file

    When ~crafted-load-custom-file~ is non-nil (the default), the =custom.el=
    file is loaded /after/ the initialization process, including after the user
    =config.el= is loaded.

    The customization variable values (as set in =init.el= with
    =customize-set-variables=) are in the =SET for current session only= state,
    unless altered by a saved customization loaded from =custom.el=. Any values
    set through the Customization UI or other work flows, for example by using
    the =org-agenda-to-front= or =org-remove-file= functions, which write to the
    =custom-set-variables= form, are preserved in the =custom.el= file if they are
    saved for future sessions (as by the Customization UI widget, or by code).

*** Not loading the =custom.el= file

    To not load the =custom file=, change the value for the
    ~crafted-load-custom-file~  to =nil= in your =config.el=.

    Using =customize-set-variable= in Emacs Lisp has the same effect as using
    the Customization UI, except the customization is not saved to =custom.el=
    as if you had used the Customization UI *and* used the widget to save the
    customizations for future sessions.

    If you choose to follow this pattern, customizing variables in your
    =config.el= only (not using the UI) then you may never need to load
    =custom.el=. However, there are some caveats: using certain work flows with
    Org Agenda files or risky variables in =.dir-locals.el= which write to the
    =custom.el= file will never be applied, even though they are saved in the
    custom file.

* Using it with =Chemacs2=

If you have the =Chemacs2= configuration cloned to =~/.emacs.d= or
=~/.config/emacs=, you can clone =crafted-emacs= anywhere you like and add an
entry to it in your =~/.emacs-profiles.el= file:

You can then put your =early-config.el= and =config.el= files in the subfolder
=~/path/to/crafted-emacs/crafted-emacs=. So, for example if you installed
Crafted Emacs to =~/.crafted-emacs=, then your =early-config.el= and
=config.el= files would be in the path =~/.crafted-emacs/crafted-emacs=. This
is the default path, but you can change the name to something else, see below
for examples.

#+caption: Example of a =Chemacs2= user profile file in =~/.emacs-profiles.el=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (("crafted" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/path/to/crafted-emacs"))))

#+end_src

If you prefer to put your Crafted Emacs customizations elsewhere (for example
in a folder called `config` or maybe `personal`), you can specify the
=CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME= environment variable, for example like this:

#+caption: User =Chemacs2= profile file =~/.emacs-profiles.el= with environment variable.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (("crafted" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/path/to/crafted-emacs")
                    (env . (("CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME" . "~/path/to/crafted-emacs/personal"))))))

#+end_src

Or some place completely different:

#+caption: User =Chemacs2= profile file =~/.emacs-profiles.el= with Crafted Emacs config files set to another path.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (("crafted" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/path/to/crafted-emacs")
                    (env . (("CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME" . "~/crafted-config/personal"))))))

#+end_src


Then launch it with =emacs --with-profile crafted=!

* Transitioning from Rational Emacs to Crafted Emacs

If you previously were using *rational-emacs*, these steps will help you
transition your configuration for use with *crafted-emacs*. 

NOTE: When running the script, if there are any errors, the original code is
still in the original location.  The =crafted-emacs= folder is a copy of the
=rational-emacs= folder, all updates occur on the copy.

1. Shutdown Emacs, including killing any running server instances. 
2. Pull the recent changes from this repo: =git pull= (from where you cloned
   =rational-emacs= originally, most likely you're =.config/emacs= folder in
   your home filesystem). This will convert the *code* from =rational-emacs= to
   be =crafted-emacs= instead.
   - You can optionally move the rational code out of the way and clone this
     repo directly this way:
     1. =cd ~/.config/=
     2. =mv emacs emacs_rational=
     3. =git clone https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs emacs=
   - N.B. on MS Windows, the path "~/.config" is likely
     =C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\.config=, you can also just clone
     to the =.emacs.d/= folder, thus from the
     =C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\= folder, your git command would
     be:

     =git clone https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs .emacs.d=
3. From the location where you cloned this repo (=~/.config/emacs= for example),
   run this command to transition your existing =rational-emacs= configuration
   to =crafted-emacs=:

   =emacs -Q --batch -l rational2crafted.el=
4. Start Emacs. There might still be some errors (hopefully not!) you'll have to
   work through (submit an issue if you get really stuck, or reach out on
   Discord in the SystemCrafters #rational-emacs channel).

** Caveats

The script provided does not work with /chemacs2/ configurations. There is no
way to know the names of the profiles or how you might have configured Emacs
when using Rational Emacs in the past. However, the script should be
sufficiently useful enough you can either craft your own transition script with
the methods provided therein, or read the code and follow the steps manually.

** Contributing Tips for Elisp

   + Prefer =customize-set-variable= instead of =setq= for =defcustom=
     values. This helps make sure constructors or setters attached to the
     variable are run when the value is set.
   + Provide =defcustom= variables for things we expect the user to modify and
     make sure it is in the appropriate group.
   + Provide verbose doc-strings for =defvar=, =defcustom=, =defun=, =defmacro=,
     etc to clearly document what is going on.
   + Make sure to follow doc-string guidelines (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Documentation-Tips.html][Documentation Tips]] or [info:elisp#Documentation
     Tips][elisp#Documentation Tips]])
   + Add comments for blocks of code, especially to describe /why/ the code is
     present, or the intention. These comments serve as documentation when
     reading the code where a doc-string is not an option.
   + Add or update documentation in the /docs/ folder. Especially for new
     modules, please provide the info file with your PR. (see [[file:docs/CONTRIBUTING.org][Contributing Documentation]])
   + If your PR addresses an issue, whether it closes or fixes the issue, or is
     just related to it, please add the issue number in your commit message or
     the description of your PR so they can be linked together.

* Troubleshooting

  Some tips when things don't seem to work right.

** A package (suddenly?) fails to work

   This scenario happened frequently when upgrading to Emacs 28. It also may
   occur in other scenarios as well. Usually, you will see some message
   indicating some symbol is void or some function or command does not
   exist. More often than not, the package maintainer is using a feature from
   another package which has not yet been released. The new feature is available
   in the development version of the package however.

   Here are some example issues where things went wrong:
   - [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/126][Wrong number of arguments error]]
   - [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/132][Example config doesn't start]]
   - [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/140][there are some bugs in package "helpful"]]

   Here are some strategies:

   - Check the code on the package source control page (ie GitHub, GitLab or
     whatever), and make sure the missing code is present on the =master=
     branch.
   - Look at the code associated with the released version (you need to look at
     the most recent tag for this). If the code is missing there, ask the
     maintainer for a new release. Often, there are years between releases of
     Emacs packages, but that depends completely on the package maintainer. Some
     of them release more frequently, others only on request.

   Once you have done the steps above, you can choose to take one of these
   actions in your configuration:

   - Option 1
     + Use =M-x package-list-packages= to display the list of packages.
     + Find the package in the list which doesn't work for you, it will have
       either the /installed/ or /dependency/ status.
     + Press the =enter= key to get more details on the package an look near the
       bottom of the metadata, you should see a line with "Other Versions". Choose
       the development version - it will have a version number that looks like a
       date and the text =(melpa)= next to it. Press =enter= on this version.
     + Following the step above will take you to the same package but from the
       MELPA repository, and you'll see a button at the top labeled
       =Install=. Click this button.
     + *Optionally* you can go back to the list of packages, find previous
       installed version, press the letter 'D' and then the letter 'X' to
       uninstall that version.
     + Restart Emacs
   - Option 2
     + Edit your =early-config.el= file.
     + Near the bottom, add a line similar to this to pin the offending package
       to MELPA (make sure to replace /package-name/ with the name of the actual
       package):

       #+begin_src emacs-lisp
         (add-to-list 'package-pinned-packages (cons 'package-name "melpa"))
       #+end_src

     + Use =M-x package-list-packages= to display the list of packages.
     + Find the package in the list, press the letter 'D' and the letter 'X' to
       uninstall that package.
     + Restart Emacs, the package should be installed from MELPA thus using the
       development version of the package instead of the released version.

   Regardless, always feel free to open an issue here and we can help you
   out. Please be as complete as possible in your description of the
   problem. Include any stack traces Emacs provides (ie start Emacs with: =emacs
   --debug-init=), mention the version number of the package you are installing,
   and anything you might have tried but which didn't work for you.
