;; Setup completion packages. Completion in this sense is more like
;; narrowing, allowing the user to find matches based on minimal
;; inputs and "complete" the commands, variables, etc from the
;; narrowed list of possible choices.

;;; Vertico

  ;; Cycle back to top/bottom result when the edge is reached
  (customize-set-variable 'vertico-cycle t)

  ;; Start Vertico
  (vertico-mode 1)

  ;; Turn off the built-in fido-vertical-mode and icomplete-vertical-mode, if
  ;; they have been turned on by crafted-defaults-config, because they interfere
  ;; with this module.
