;; This module configures a nice base Emacs without necessarily
;; installing additional packages.  Two packages which could be used
;; are `dumb-jump' and `hydra'.  If installed, they are configured
;; here.
;;
;; For users with Emacs prior to version 28, `icomplete-mode' is
;; enabled with an method to install a vertical mode to make it work
;; more like `fido-vertical-mode' from Emacs 28.  The defun is only
;; provided for Emacsen prior to 28.
