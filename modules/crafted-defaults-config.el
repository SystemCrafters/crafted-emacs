;; General Crafted Emacs endorsed defaults

;; - Mickey Petersen: "Mastering Emacs",

;; in separate dired buffers.  Makes copying or moving files between
;; directories easier.  The value `t' means to guess the default
;; target directory.

;; treat manual buffer switching (C-x b for example) the same as
;; programmatic buffer switching.
