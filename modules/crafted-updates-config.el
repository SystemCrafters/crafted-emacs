;;; Commentary:

;; Checks for updates to the Crafted Emacs project.  Provides a
;; function to show the updates before pulling changes.

;; This uses `crafted-emacs-home', which is set on load if it hasn't been
;; set by the user or by `crafted-init-config'. It expects that directory
;; to be a git directory that can be used to checking on updates from
;; upstream.  Defensively would still need to check if that location
;; is `bound-and-true-p' before doing anything.
