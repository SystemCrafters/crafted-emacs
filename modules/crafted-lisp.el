;;; Commentary:

;; Configuration for the Lisp family of languages, including Common
;; Lisp, Clojure, Scheme, and Racket.

;; For Common Lisp, configure SLY and a few related packages.
;;    An implementation of CL will need to be installed, examples are:
;;    * CLISP (GNU Common Lisp)
;;    * CMUCL (Carnegie-Mellon Common Lisp)
;;    * SBCL (Steel-Bank Common Lisp)

;; For Clojure, configure cider, clj-refactor

;; For Scheme and Racket, configure geiser.
;;   Out of the box, geiser already supports some scheme
;;   implementations.  However, there are several modules which can be
;;   added to geiser for specific implementations:
;;   * geiser-chez
;;   * geiser-chibi
;;   * geiser-chicken
;;   * geiser-gambit
;;   * geiser-gauche
;;   * geiser-guile
;;   * geiser-kawa
;;   * geiser-mit
;;   * geiser-racket
;;   * geiser-stklos

;;; Code:

;; Global defaults
(require 'eldoc)
;; keeps code indented even when copy/pasting.

;;; Scheme and Racket
;; As we wish to make Crafted Emacs work well with GNU Guix, we start
;; the configuration with the GNU Guile loaded. Additional
;; implementations can be added by installing the appropriate package
;; and (possibly) adding that implementation to the list of geiser
;; active implmentations. Racket configuration is also provided out of
;; the box.
