;; User interface customizations. Examples are icons, line numbers,
;; and how help buffers are displayed.

;; This package provides a basic, customized appearance for
;; Emacs. Specifically, it uses: Helpful to customize the information
;; and visual display of help buffers, such as that created by M-x
;; `describe-function'; All-the-icons, to provide font-based icons
;; (rather than raster or vector images); and includes some Emacs Lisp
;; demonstrations.

;;  Run `all-the-icons-install-fonts' to ensure the fonts necessary
;; for ALL THE ICONS are available on your system. You must run this
;; function if the "stop" icon at the beginning of this paragraph is
;; not displayed properly (it appears as a box with some numbers
;; and/or letters inside it).

;; Read the documentation for `all-the-icons'; on Windows,
;; `all-the-icons-install-fonts' only downloads fonts, they must be
;; installed manually. This is necessary if icons are not displaying
;; properly.
