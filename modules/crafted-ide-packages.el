;; Eglot package installation for Emacs prior to version 29.

;;; Code:

;;; Eglot for Emacs before version 29
;; Add Eglot only for Emacs prior to version 29.  It is built-in since
;; Emacs 29.
(when (version< emacs-version "29")
  ;; LSP capabilities
  (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'eglot)

  ;; tree-sitter syntax aware packages
  (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'tree-sitter)
  (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'tree-sitter-indent)
  (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'tree-sitter-ispell)
  (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'tree-sitter-langs))

;;; Emacs 29 packages
(when (version< "29" emacs-version)
  ;; automatically handles switching to tree-sitter versions of major
  ;; modes, can install grammars, etc.
  (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'treesit-auto))

;;; Editorconfig
;; editorconfig is a cross-editor/ide configuration tool to control
;; indentation, spaces vs tabs, etc.  It is built-in since Emacs 30.
(when (version< emacs-version "30")
  (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'editorconfig))

;;; Aggressive Indent
;; a minor mode to always keep your code indented while editing blocks
;; of code.
(add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'aggressive-indent)

;;; Ibuffer Project
;; as most development is done on projects, add ibuffer-project to
;; group project buffers together when listing buffers with ibuffer
(add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'ibuffer-project)

;;; Environment-Variables Setup
;; Emacs IDE features often rely on external tools (such as, LSP servers,
;; interpreters, compilers, linters, etc).  This package ensures that Emacs
;; knows where the executables of these tools are located.
