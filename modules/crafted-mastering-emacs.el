;;
;; This module configures a nice base Emacs without necessarily
;; installing additional packages.  Enabling `dumb-jump' will install
;; the package and configure it.  Enabling `hydra' will install the
;; package and use it, if it is available, when configuring
;; `dumb-jump'.  See the appropriate defuns below.
;;
;; For users with Emacs prior to version 28, `icomplete-mode' is
;; enabled with an method to install a vertical mode to make it work
;; more like `fido-vertical-mode' from Emacs 28.  The defun is only
;; provided for Emacsen prior to 28.
