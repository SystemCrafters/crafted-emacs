* Using =straight.el=

Early in the lifetime of this project, the project used =straight.el=
to install packages. However, after a discussion, the community
decided to move to using =package.el= instead as it lined up with the
principles of the project more than =straight.el=; notably, it is
built in and one of the principles specifically states "Prioritize
built-in Emacs functionality".

However, as many people who started with this project preferred to use
=straight.el=, the move to =package.el= was suboptimal. This directory
contains an example configuration switching back to using
=straight.el= with *Rational Emacs*.
