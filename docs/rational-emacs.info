Rational Emacs
**************

Hacking one’s Emacs configuration is, for some, an ongoing endeavor.
For others, it just needs to work.  Other configuration packages attempt
to be a complete, canned, working configuration, while Rational attempts
to provide the bare minimum to get you started.  More like a framework
than a complete solution, Rational Emacs intends to provide a sensible
place to start configuring your Emacs to your needs.

   Defaults provided here were provided by a community of volunteers and
ideally represent sane defaults from which to start.  We expect you to
have different opinions than ours and we expect you to implement those
differences in your own configuration.  Our intent is to provide
something you might find useful to get your started on your own Emacs
configuration journey.

1 Principles
************

This configuration and all associated modules intend to follow these
principles:

   • Minimal, modular configuration

        • The core configuration only sets up Emacs to have a cleaner
          presentation with sensible defaults.  It is up to the user to
          decide which modules to load and when to load them.

        • Modules should not depend on other modules as much as
          possible.  When a module needs to integrate with other
          functionality in Emacs, the standard extensibility points of
          each package should be used.  The implication is someone
          should be able to copy code from a module into their own
          configuration _without_ using Rational Emacs.

   • Prioritize built-in Emacs functionality

     Where possible, we will leverage built-in Emacs functionality
     instead of external packages.

     Some of the packages we prefer:

        • ‘project.el’ for project management.

        • ‘tab-bar-mode’ for organizing groups of buffers.

        • ‘whitespace.el’ to cleanup whitespace, like tabs, newlines or
          additional space added to the end of lines.

        • ‘pulse.el’ to flash the current line under certain conditions.

        • And others...

     This is not to take away from the amazing work package providers
     have contributed to the Emacs community.  By prioritizing built-in
     features, we can highlight less known packages, have a more stable
     product, and reduce the amount of network load just to get started.
     Indeed, if you do not pull in any of the modules we provide, you
     may not even need a network (other than to clone the repo from
     GitHub).

   • Works well in the terminal

     Not everyone uses a windowing environment, and the terminal is
     popular for remote sessions as well as command line utilities.
     Working well in the terminal also enables the use of Emacs in
     Termux on Android!

   • Can be integrated with a Guix configuration

     GNU Guix is a functional package manager and GNU Linux
     distribution.  This integration enables setting things like font
     sizes, themes, etc in a system-specific and repeatable way.

   • Works well with ‘Chemacs2’

     Having multiple configurations available allows for testing
     individual package combinations or configurations from others.
     ‘Chemacs2’ allows for having multiple configurations simultaneously
     and Rational Emacs should work well in this environment also.

   • Helps you learn Emacs Lisp

     Instead of providing a higher-level configuration system out of the
     box like other Emacs configurations (like Doom or Spacemacs for
     example), we follow standard Emacs Lisp patterns so you can learn
     by reading the configuration.  This means we don’t provide macro
     wrappers around packaging and configuration tools.  No complex
     framework exists.

2 Why use it?
*************

Why choose this configuration over _Doom Emacs_, _Spacemacs_, _Prelude_,
or others?

   The goal of this configuration is to make it easier to write your own
Emacs configuration while using pre-made configuration parts maintained
by the community.  Instead of using a monolithic, all-encompassing
approach, we strive to ensure that all parts of this configuration are
optional or interchangeable.

   You should even be able to use the configuration modules we provide
with your own ‘init.el’ file without using this base configuration repo!


File: rational-emacs.info,  Node: Customization,  Next: Using it with Chemacs2,  Prev: Why use it?,  Up: Top

3 Customization
***************

To add your own customization to this configuration, create a
configuration file in one of the following places:

   • ‘~/.rational-emacs/’
   • ‘~/.config/rational-emacs/’

   In your configuration you can set any Emacs configuration variable,
face attributes, themes, etc as you normally would.

   If you prefer to explicitly control where your ‘config.el’ and
‘early-config.el’ are found for Rational Emacs, you may provide a value
for the ‘RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME’ environment variable, either on the
command line or in your shell configuration.  This variable should only
contain the path to the ‘config.el’ files, for example:

     RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME=~/my-rational-emacs-config


Listing 3.1: Set environment variable ‘RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME’ to the path
of the configuration directory.

* The ‘custom.el’ file: The customel file.


File: rational-emacs.info,  Node: How the rational config file is found,  Next: Example Configuration,  Up: Customization

3.1 How the rational config file is found
=========================================

The rational config files (‘config.el’ and ‘early-config.el’) are found
in the ‘rational-config-path’.  That path will match exactly one of the
following scenarios, in the order specified:

   • Using ‘Chemacs2’ (See below for more on this)
        • The environment variable ‘RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME’ is used if
          provided in the profile definition.
        • The profile directory is used when no environment variable is
          provided in the profile definition.
   • Use the value found in the ‘RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME’ environment
     variable.
   • The environment variable ‘XDG_CONFIG_HOME’ is present or the path
     ‘$HOME/.config/rational-emacs’ exists.
        • These normally resolve to the same file, so build the path
          from the ‘XDG_CONFIG_HOME’ environment variable or the
          explicit path ‘~/.config/rational-emacs’
   • Use the ‘HOME’ environment variable to make the path, which expands
     to ‘$HOME/.rational-emacs’.

   Once the ‘rational-config-path’ is determined, if it does not exist
in the file system, it is created.  However, just the path is created,
the files ‘config.el’ and ‘early-config.el’ must be created by you.

File: rational-emacs.info,  Node: Simplified overview of how Emacs Customization works,  Next: Loading the customel file,  Up: The customel file

3.3.1 Simplified overview of how Emacs Customization works
----------------------------------------------------------

Customizable values are defined with the ‘defcustom’ form, and can be
customized using the Easy Customization UI.  A complete discussion is
out of scope for this document, instead see the Emacs Manual for more
information.

   There are several states a value can be in, for our purposes, we will
only consider two of them: the default state and the changed state.
These are not the "official" names but easily convey the concepts of the
variable.  If a value is in the default state, looking in the
Customization UI, the state will be listed as ‘STANDARD’.  Rational
Emacs takes the approach of using the ‘customize-set-variable’ to update
the values defined with ‘defcustom’.  This will show the values as ‘SET
for current session only’ in the Customization UI.  This is normal since
the values are set each time Emacs starts.  They are technically "SAVED"
since they exist as emacs-lisp code, but since they are not in a
‘custom-set-variables’ form the Customization UI only sees them as "SET
for the current session only".

   A ‘SAVED and set’ value means the Customization code has written the
configuration to disk to be loaded again the next time Emacs starts.
When Emacs saves the configuration from the Customization UI, it simply
adds a couple of forms to the end of your initialization file (typically
‘init.el’), with comments warning about having more than one form with
the same name (see example below).


File: rational-emacs.info,  Node: Loading the customel file,  Next: Not loading the customel file,  Prev: Simplified overview of how Emacs Customization works,  Up: The customel file

3.3.2 Loading the ‘custom.el’ file
----------------------------------

This is important because if you, the user, wish to use the
Customization UI to configure Emacs, the customizations will (by
default) be written to the bottom of the ‘init.el’ file in a form called
‘custom-set-variables’ and ‘custom-set-faces’.  These are loaded usually
at the end of the init cycle (which is why they are listed at the bottom
of the ‘init.el’ file) and allows restoring values set by the
Customization UI rather than through code.

   This configuration sets the ‘custom-file’ to exist in the
‘rational-config-path’ (see above) as a file known as ‘custom.el’.  This
file is *not* automatically loaded by Rational Emacs configuration.  You
may, if you choose, load this file yourself with the following code in
your ‘config.el’ file.

     (load "custom")

   It is important to load this file last to make sure it overrides any
values previously set while Emacs was starting.

   If you are using something like the example provided above, you might
have something that looks more like this:

     (require 'rational-defaults)
     (require 'rational-screencast)
     (require 'rational-ui)
     (require 'rational-editing)
     (require 'rational-evil)
     (require 'rational-completion)
     (require 'rational-windows)

     (rational-package-install-package 'doom-themes)
     (load-theme 'doom-one t)

     (load "custom")
     ;;; example-config.el ends here


Listing 3.3: Example ‘config.el’ loading the ‘custom.el’ file.

   And then in ‘custom.el’ you would have something like the following
which is auto-generated by Emacs:

     (custom-set-variables
      ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
      ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
      ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
      ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
      '(rational-ui-default-font '(:font "JetBrains Mono" :weight light :height 185))
      '(rational-ui-display-line-numbers t))
     (custom-set-faces
      ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
      ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
      ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
      ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
      )


Listing 3.4: Example auto-generated ‘custom.el’ file.


File: rational-emacs.info,  Node: Not loading the customel file,  Next: Caveat on the timing of loading customel,  Prev: Loading the customel file,  Up: The customel file

3.3.3 Not loading the ‘custom.el’ file
--------------------------------------

You may choose not to load the ‘custom.el’ file if you are writing your
own configuration with Emacs-Lisp.  Using ‘customize-set-variable’ has
the same effect as using the Customization UI, with the primary
difference, the customization is not written later as if you had used
the Customization UI.  If you choose to follow this pattern, you will
not need to load the ‘custom.el’ file ever.  Our example (see above)
could imply the use of the Customization UI, as our example uses the
‘custom-set-variables’ form to set a list of customizable values all at
once.  Here is the same example written differently.

     (require 'rational-defaults)
     (require 'rational-screencast)
     (require 'rational-ui)
     (require 'rational-editing)
     (require 'rational-evil)
     (require 'rational-completion)
     (require 'rational-windows)

     (customize-set-variable 'rational-ui-default-font
                             '(:font "JetBrains Mono" :weight light :height 185))
     (customize-set-variable 'rational-ui-display-line-numbers t)

     (rational-package-install-package 'doom-themes)
     (load-theme 'doom-one t)


Listing 3.5: Example ‘config.el’ setting customization variables
directly.


File: rational-emacs.info,  Node: Caveat on the timing of loading customel,  Prev: Not loading the customel file,  Up: The customel file

3.3.4 Caveat on the timing of loading ‘custom.el’
-------------------------------------------------

Even if you are using emacs-lisp to customize Emacs, you may still
choose to load the ‘custom.el’ file.  Keep in mind, if you use
‘customize-set-variable’ or ‘setq’ to set the value for a ‘defcustom’
option and then load the ‘custom.el’ file which might have the same
variable set with a different value, the last thing to set that value
wins.

   Here is an example, first a ‘config.el’ snippet:

     ;; ... some customization before
     (customize-set-variable 'display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
     ;; ... some more customization

     (load "custom")


Listing 3.6: ‘config.el’ snippet loading ‘custom.el’ last

   and the ‘custom.el’ snippet

     (custom-set-variables
      '(display-line-numbers-type t))


Listing 3.7: ‘custom.el’ snippet.

   The value of the ‘display-line-numbers-type’ will be ‘t’.  Since the
‘custom.el’ file is loaded last the first value of the
‘display-line-numbers-type’ is overwritten.  The fix is to make sure you
set the value only once in your configuration with either
‘customize-set-variable’ or with ‘custom-set-variables’ either in your
‘config.el’ or loaded from ‘custom.el’

4 Using it with ‘Chemacs2’
**************************

If you have the ‘Chemacs2’ configuration cloned to ‘~/.emacs.d’ or
‘~/.config/emacs’, you can clone ‘rational-emacs’ anywhere you like and
add an entry to it in your ‘~/.emacs-profiles.el’ file:

   You can then put your ‘early-config.el’ and ‘config.el’ files in the
sub-folder ‘~/path/to/rational-emacs/rational-emacs’.  So, for example
if you installed Rational Emacs to ‘~/.rational-emacs’, then your
‘early-config.el’ and ‘config.el’ files would be in the path
‘~/.rational-emacs/rational-emacs’.  This is the default path, but you
can change the name to something else, see below for examples.


     (("rational" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/path/to/rational-emacs"))))



Listing 4.1: Example of a ‘Chemacs2’ user profile file in
‘~/.emacs-profiles.el’.

   If you prefer to put your Rational Emacs customizations elsewhere
(for example in a folder called ‘config‘ or maybe ‘personal‘), you can
specify the ‘RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME’ environment variable, for example like
this:


     (("rational" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/path/to/rational-emacs")
                     (env . (("RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME" . "~/path/to/rational-emacs/personal"))))))



Listing 4.2: User ‘Chemacs2’ profile file ‘~/.emacs-profiles.el’ with
environment variable.

   Or some place completely different:


     (("rational" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/path/to/rational-emacs")
                     (env . (("RATIONAL_EMACS_HOME" . "~/rational-config/personal"))))))



Listing 4.3: User ‘Chemacs2’ profile file ‘~/.emacs-profiles.el’ with
Rational Emacs config files set to another path.

   Then launch it with ‘emacs --with-profile rational’!

6 Modules
*********

Rational Emacs includes a number of modules to further configure Emacs.
These are intended to be stand-alone in the sense that no module
requires the use of any other module.

   The modules are written to support various themes: mini-buffer
selection (completion), editing, ui, etc.  To use these modules, simply
‘require’ them in your ‘config.el’, or copy the relevant portions to
your ‘config.el’ and modify them to suit your needs.

   In most cases, you can ‘require’ the module, and then adjust the
configuration for specific parts by overriding the settings provided by
the module by additional code in your ‘config.el’.

   While the intent here is to document each module as completely as
reasonably possible, the best-practice is to simply read the code for
the module of interest to understand it best.

6.1 Rational Emacs Completion Module
====================================

To use this module, simply require it in your config.

     (require 'rational-completion)

   This module installs and sets up a set of completion-related packages
that work together to achieve a functionality that you might know from
packages like ‘helm’ or ‘ivy’.  They are much more modular than those
packages and also strive to rely on built-in functionality.  With that,
they fit perfectly into the Rational Emacs principles.  But if you
prefer an all-in-one approach, you can just leave this module off and
use one of the more established completion frameworks.  Give it a try,
though.  In concert, these packages might deliver just the experience
you want.

vertico (https://github.com/minad/vertico)             minimalistic vertical completion UI based on the default completion system
orderless (https://github.com/oantolin/orderless)      completion style that matches candidates in any order
consult (https://github.com/minad/consult)             provides practical commands based on the Emacs completion function
marginalia (https://github.com/minad/marginalia/)      adds info to the minibuffer completions on the side (in the marginalia)
embark (https://github.com/oantolin/embark/)           provides a set of possible actions for a given context
corfu (https://github.com/minad/corfu/)                provides a completion overlay for completions while typing

   To explain what the packages do and how they interact, it’s best to
go through them step by step.  For each step, imagine you want to switch
buffers but you neither remember the binding nor the command to do that.
Neither do you remember that the command starts with "switch".  But
you’re sure it was something with buffers, so you hit "M-x" and type
‘buf’.

   A fresh Emacs install would actually be pretty helpful for that
already.  After ‘buf’ you could hit <SPC> or <TAB> to complete to
‘buffer-’ and after trying several continutations without success, you’d
hit <TAB> repeatedly to find out that the command you’re looking for
apparently doesn’t start with "buffer".

 [image src="img/01-vanilla.png" ]


   So you’d try something else, you’d eventually start typing with ‘swi’
and arrive at ‘switch-to-buffer’ rather quickly, via completion.  Emacs
would even show you that there are more than one command that start with
that and present you with the keybindings.

 [image src="img/02-vanilla.png" ]


   That’s OK, but there’s a lot of room for improvement.  That’s where
the five packages come in.

   • Vertico

     Vertico is a "minimalistic vertical completion UI" which means that
     when Emacs has a list of candidates that could be completed, it
     offers a list of them in a vertical arrangement.

     If you hit "M-x" and start typing ‘buf’ with vertico installed,
     Emacs shows you a list of all available commands that start with
     "buf".  No need to trigger any completions, it’s just there.

 [image src="img/03-vertico.png" ]


     So this time, you immediately see that no commands with "change" or
     "switch" is in the list and that you have to start with something
     else.  You will probably arrive at the command you’re looking for
     much easier and quicker.

   • Orderless

     Orderless splits your search string and gives you candidates that
     match them regardless of the order.  So with vertico *and*
     orderless installed, it doesn’t matter anymore that you started to
     type ‘buf’.  No need to go back and start with ‘swi’.  With ‘buf’
     <SPC> ‘swi’ you’ll see all commands that contain both components of
     your search.

 [image src="img/04-vertico-orderless.png" ]


     This time, you achieved your goal at the first try.  And Emacs
     still showed you the other commands and their keybindings.  You
     might go and check out what they might do, but wouldn’t it be nice
     if Emacs had already told you?  Time for marginalia.

   • Marginalia

     Marginalia offers helpful information in the minibuffer when
     completions are offered.  So with vertico, orderless and marginalia
     installed, your search for ‘buf’ <SPC> ‘swi’ shows you a list of
     all matching commands with a short info on what they’re doing.

 [image src="img/05-vertico-orderless-marginalia.png" ]


   • Consult

     Consult provides a set of practical commands.  A lot of them are
     replacements for built-in everyday functions
     (https://github.com/minad/consult#available-commands).  (For
     example, try replacing ‘switch-to-buffer’ with ‘consult-buffer’.
     Or replace ‘yank-pop’ with ‘consult-yank-pop’).  However, Rational
     Emacs leaves most of that untouched.  It’s up to you as the user.
     The module ‘rational-completion’ sets three consult functions for
     you that fit into the completion behaviour described above.

        • Search-/filtering candidates and bind "C-s" to ‘consult-line’

          Whenever you’re presented with candidates for completions,
          consult provides a filtering search function which updates not
          only the list of candidates in the minibuffer, but also the
          active buffer in a sort of live preview (if applicable).
          Rational Emacs also replaces ‘isearch’ with ‘consult-line’, so
          that searching through your buffer gives you the same
          behaviour.  Essentially, ‘isearch-backward’ becomes obsolete,
          because consult shows you the forward matches first and next
          the backward matches and you can cycle through them.

        • Bind "C-r" in the minibuffer to ‘consult-history’

          Whenever you’re presented with candidates for completions in a
          minibuffer, ‘consult’ automatically sorts your most recently
          used candidates to the top.  Also it is searchable like with
          ‘consult-line’.  Inside a minibuffer, you can also hit "C-r"
          to show *only* the candidates you have used before.

 [image src="img/07-consult-history.png" ]


        • Use ‘consult-completion-in-region’ as completion function

          Completion not only comes into effect in the minibuffer, but
          also (depending on other settings – like major mode) within
          your main buffer.  E.g.  completing function or variable names
          etc.

          *Without* ‘consult’, triggering a completion gives you a
          static list of candidates if there is more than one.

 [image src="img/08-completion-without-consult.png" ]


          *With* ‘consult’, the list of candidates is dynamic as you
          type and updates the current selection in the buffer.

   • Embark

     Embark is very versatile package that does far more than can be
     described here.  We highly recommend to read through the packages
     documentation (https://github.com/oantolin/embark).

     As it’s set up in this module, Embark offers two main features:

        • ‘embark-act’

          The ‘embark-act’ function (bound to "C-.")  offers you a lot
          of possible actions that can be applied to the element of the
          buffer (or minibuffer) in which your cursor is positioned.
          You can think of this as a context menu, similar to what you
          achieve in many user interfaces by right-clicking on
          something.

          But ‘embark-act’ can be used for much more, have a look at the
          video The Many Uses of Embark (https://youtu.be/qk2Is_sC8Lk)
          in the System Crafters Channel.

        • ‘embark-bindings’ & ‘embark-prefix-help-command’

          Rational Emacs replaces ‘describe-bindings’ and
          ‘prefix-help-command’ with their Embark-alternatives to
          provide a functionality similar to packages like ‘which-key’:
          It shows you available options and commands, but with all the
          goodies provided by the other packages above.

          For one last time, imagine you want so switch buffers and have
          forgotten how.  But this time, you also remember that there
          was a binding for it, probably starting with "C-x".

          You can hit "C-x C-h" to see a list of possible bindings after
          the "C-x" prefix.  But you don’t need to cycle through them,
          you can fuzzy-filter them.  Type "buf" to see only the
          bindings that relate to buffers.

 [image src="img/10-filtered-describe-bindings.png" ]


   • Corfu and Corfu-Doc

     Corfu provides a completion overlay while you are typing similar to
     how other IDEs popup completions.  Corfu-Doc adds a documentation
     overlay next to the completion overlay which shows some
     documentation about the function or variable being completed.

     Use ‘C-n’ or ‘C-p’ to move the next or previous completion in the
     list.  To read more of the documentation, use ‘M-n’ or ‘M-p’ to
     scroll the documentation overlay.

6.2 Rational Emacs Defaults Module
==================================

To use this module, simply require it in your config.

     (require 'rational-defaults)

   • ‘global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers’ : ‘t’

     Automatically update buffers changed outside Emacs, or by other
     Emacs processes, for example, version control.  This affects
     buffers not backed by files.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your ‘config.el’

          (customize-set-variable 'global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers nil)

   • ‘global-auto-revert-mode’

     Global minor mode to revert any buffer when it changes either on
     disk or via another process, for example, version control.

     Turn this off by adding this code to your ‘config.el’

          (global-auto-revert-mode -1)

   • ‘delete-selection-mode’

     Typed text replaces the selection if the selection is active,
     pressing delete or backspace deletes the selection.  To turn this
     off, add this code to your ‘config.el’

          (delete-selection-mode -1)

   • ‘indent-tabs-mode’ : ‘nil’

     Only indent using spaces.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your ‘config.el’

          (customize-set-variable 'indent-tabs-mode t)

   • ‘y-or-n-p’

     Use shorter query responses (’y’ or ’n’ instead of ’yes’ or ’no’).
     This is managed by Emacs advice functionality.  It can be reverted
     in your ‘config.el’ by adding the code:

          (advice-remove 'yes-or-no-p #'y-or-n-p)

     In Emacs versions beginning with 28, use the ‘use-short-answers’
     variable set to ‘t’ instead to accomplish the same thing.

   • ‘recentf-mode’

     This minor mode saves the files you visit as a recent file so you
     can load that file again quickly.  The command ‘recentf-open-files’
     will display a menu of files you opened recently so you can quickly
     open it again.  This mode is added to the ‘after-init-hook’ which
     runs when Emacs is starting but after the initialization files have
     completed running.

   • ‘recentf-save-file’ : ‘/path/to/rational-emacs/var/recentf’

     This is the file which will hold the list of recent files.  It is
     located in the ‘var’ folder where your Rational Emacs configuration
     files reside.  You can find that path by using the
     ‘describe-variable’ function, which is also bound to the ‘C-h v’
     keybinding, and then providing the variable name
     ‘rational-config-var-directory’.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your ‘config.el’ (make sure to set the path
     correctly)

          (customize-set-variable 'recentf-save-file "/some/path/to/recentf")

   • ‘kill-do-not-save-duplicates’ : ‘t’

     The ‘kill-ring’ is where Emacs stores the strings to paste later.
     This variable prohibits Emacs from storing duplicates of strings
     which are already on the ‘kill-ring’

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your ‘config.el’

          (customize-set-variable 'kill-do-not-save-duplicates nil)

   • ‘auto-window-vscroll’ : ‘nil’

     This causes Emacs to not automatically adjust window-vscroll to
     view tall lines.

     Change this by adding this code to your ‘config.el’

          (setq auto-window-vscroll t)

   • ‘fast-but-imprecise-scrolling’ : ‘t’

     Improves scrolling speed by not rendering fontification updates
     unless the text would actually be visible in the buffer.  Applies
     when scrolling very fast.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your ‘config.el’

          (customize-set-variable 'fast-but-imprecise-scrolling nil)

   • ‘scroll-conservatively’ : ‘101’

     Never recenter the point when it has scrolled off the screen,
     instead only scroll just enough to bring the point back into view.

     Change this value to less than 100 to cause the point to be
     recentered in certain cases instead of scrolling just into view.
     This value can be changed in the Customization UI or by adding this
     code to your ‘config.el’ where ‘nnn’ is some number of lines to
     scroll.

          (customize-set-variable 'scroll-conservatively nnn)

   • ‘scroll-margin’ : ‘0’

     The number of lines at the top or bottom of a window where
     scrolling starts.

     Change this value in the Customization UI or by adding this code to
     your ‘custom.el’ where ‘nn’ is some number of lines at the top or
     bottom of a buffer where scrolling should start (for example: 5)

          (customize-set-variable 'scroll-margin nn)

   • ‘scroll-preserve-screen-position’ : ‘t’

     Controls if scroll commands move point to keep its screen position
     unchanged.

     A value of t means point keeps its screen position if the scroll
     command moved it vertically out of the window, e.g.  when scrolling
     by full screens.

     Change this value in the Customization UI or by adding this code to
     ‘custom.el’

          (customize-set-variable 'scroll-preserve-screen-position nil)

   • ‘bidi-paragraph-direction’ : ‘left-to-right’

     Forces directionality of text paragraphs in the buffer.  Rational
     Emacs sets the defualt value as ‘left-to-right’, which means for
     buffers which don’t have their own value, this one will be used.
     You can change this through the Customization UI or by addding the
     following code in ‘config.el’

          (customize-set-variable 'bidi-paragraph-direction 'right-to-left)

   • ‘bidi-inhibit-bpa’ : ‘t’

     This setting will inhibit the Bidirectional Parentheses Algorithm,
     which makes redisplay faster.  You can change the value of this
     variable by adding this code to ‘custom.el’

          (setq bidi-inhibit-bpa nil)

   • ‘global-so-long-mode’

     Improves performance for files with excessively long lines.  This
     can minor mode can be turned off in ‘config.el’ by adding:

          (global-so-long-mode -1)

   • ‘executable-make-buffer-file-executable-if-script-p’

     This makes a shell script executable on save and is called after
     saving the file.  To remove this behavior add the following to
     ‘config.el’

          (remove-hook 'after-save-hook 'executable-make-buffer-file-executable-if-script-p)

   • ‘savehist-mode’

     This minor mode saves minibuffer history in the ‘history’ file
     usually found in your Rational Emacs configuration ‘var’ folder.
     You can change where the file should live with the Customization UI
     or by adding the following to ‘config.el’

          (customize-set-variable 'savehist-file
                                  "/path/to/minibuffer/history/file")

     You can turn off this mode by adding this code to ‘config.el’

          (savehist-mode -1)

6.3 Rational Emacs Editing Module
=================================

To use this module, simply require it in your config.

     (require 'rational-editing)

   • Whitespace

     Keeping a file reasonably clean of dangling or other useless
     whitespace is the focus of the next bit of configuration.

     See *note the Emacs manual: (emacs)Useless Whitespace. for more
     information.

   • ‘whitespace-style’ : ‘(face tabs empty trailing tab-mark
     indentation::space)’

     This configures the types of whitespace to visualize and cleanup,
     there are several options:

        • ‘face’: enable all visualization via faces (see below).

        • ‘tabs’: TABs are visualized via faces.  It has effect only if
          face (see above) is present in whitespace-style.

        • ‘empty’: empty lines at beginning and/or end of buffer are
          visualized via faces.  It has effect only if face (see above)
          is present in whitespace-style.

        • ‘trailing’: trailing blanks are visualized via faces.  It has
          effect only if face (see above) is present in
          whitespace-style.

        • ‘tab-mark’: TABs are visualized via display table

        • ‘indentation::space’: TABs at beginning of line are visualized
          via faces.  It has effect only if face (see above) is present
          in whitespace-style.

     See the commentary for this variable (‘C-h v whitespace-style RET’)
     for more options.  This variable can be changed through the
     Customization UI or by adding to ‘config.el’

          ;; change the list of options to be what you wish based on the values
          ;; mentioned in the commentary for this variable
          ;; (C-h v whitespace-style RET)
          (customize-set-variable 'whitespace-style
                                  '(face tabs empty trailing tab-mark
                                         indentation::space))

   • ‘whitespace-action’ : ‘(cleanup auto-cleanup)’

     This specifies what action to take when a buffer is visited or
     written.

        • ‘cleanup’: cleanup any bogus whitespace always when local
          whitespace is turned on.  See whitespace-cleanup and
          whitespace-cleanup-region.

        • ‘auto-cleanup’: cleanup any bogus whitespace when buffer is
          written.  See whitespace-cleanup and
          whitespace-cleanup-region.

     See the commentary for this variable (‘C-h v whitespace-action
     RET’) for more options.  This variable can be changed through the
     Customization UI or by adding to ‘config.el’

          ;; change the list of options to be what you wish based on the values
          ;; mentioned in the commentary for this variable
          ;; (C-h v whitespace-action RET)
          (customize-set-variable 'whitespace-action '(cleanup auto-cleanup))

   • ‘whitespace-mode’

     This minor mode is added to ‘prog-mode’ and ‘text-mode’ via hooks.
     To change this, add code similar to the following to ‘config.el’

          (remove-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'whitespace-mode)

   • ‘electric-pair-mode’

     This minor mode will automatically insert balanced characters when
     the opening character is inserted.  This applies to

        • ‘()’
        • ‘{}’
        • ‘[]’
        • ‘""’
        • ‘<>’

     This can be turned off by adding this code to ‘config.el’

          (electric-pair-mode -1)

     Alternatively, if this should only apply to certain modes,
     programming language modes for example, this code would be used:

          (electric-pair-mode -1)                         ; turn off globally

          (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'electric-pair-mode) ; turn on only for
                                                          ; programming modes

   • ‘show-paren-mode’

     This minor mode highlights matching parens ‘()’, including braces
     ‘{}’, square brackets ‘[]’, and angle brackets ‘<>’.

     This can be turned off by adding this code to ‘config.el’

          (show-paren-mode -1)

     Alternatively, if this should only apply to certain modes,
     programming language modes for example, this code would be used:

          (show-paren-mode -1)                         ; turn off globally

          (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'show-paren-mode) ; turn on only for
                                                       ; programming modes

6.4 Rational Emacs Lisp Module
==============================

This module installs and configures a few additonal packages to provide
a configuration for the Lisp family of languages including Common Lisp,
Clojure, Scheme, and Racket.

   • Prerequisites:

     Obviously, an implementation of one of the languages mentioned
     above would need to be installed.  Examples would be (a
     non-exhaustive list):

        • Common Lisp:
             • CLISP (GNU Common Lisp) <https://clisp.sourceforge.io>

               GNU’s implementation, cross platform, a good choice for
               people who need to target Microsoft Windows, Mac OS,
               and/or Linux.

             • CMUCL (Carnegie-Mellon Common Lisp) <https://cmucl.org>

               An implementation from Carnegie-Mellon university.  Known
               to be fairly fast with a native compiler.  Runs on most
               Unix platforms.

             • SBCL (Steel-Bank Common Lisp) <http://sbcl.org>

               A fork of CMUCL and ostensibly the most popular
               implementation, though there aren’t many user visible
               differences between SBCL and CMUCL.

        • Clojure <https://clojure.org>

        • Scheme:
             • GNU Guile <https://www.gnu.org/software/guile>

               The GNU Ubiquitious Intelligent Language for Extensions,
               can be combined with C/C++ programs as an extension
               language or can be used stand-alone and features a
               compiler and vitual machine.  Popularly used with the GNU
               Guix package manager used natively by the GNU Guix Linux
               distribution, although it can be used with other Linux
               distributions as well.

             • Chez <https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme>

               Known to be extremely fast, with a native compiler
               providing binaries on par with compiled C code.

             • Gauche <https://practical-scheme.net/gauche>

               Built to start start nearly instantly, targeted as a
               shell scripting tool.

        • Racket <https://racket-lang.org>

          Promoted as a language for language developers, is cross
          platform with a few pedagogical books to help beginners learn
          to write software, as well as many advanced features.

6.4.2 Common
------------

Aggressive indent mode is added to each of the other lisp family
configurations.  It provides automatic indentation, even when pasting
code or adding structure.  It is added on each mode hook, to turn this
feature off, remove the hook.  For example:

     (remove-hook 'lisp-mode-hook #'aggressive-indent-mode)

   • Hooks ‘aggressive-mode’ is added to:
        • ‘lisp-mode-hook’
        • ‘scheme-mode-hook’
        • ‘clojure-mode-hook’


File: rational-emacs.info,  Node: Common Lisp,  Next: Clojure,  Prev: Common,  Up: Rational Emacs Lisp Module

6.4.3 Common Lisp
-----------------

The configuration for Common Lisp features Sylvester the cat’s Common
Lisp IDE for Emacs.  It provides a debugger, inspecter, xref,
completion, integration with ASDF and Quicklsp system definition tools.


File: rational-emacs.info,  Node: Clojure,  Next: Scheme/Racket,  Prev: Common Lisp,  Up: Rational Emacs Lisp Module

6.4.4 Clojure
-------------

The configuration for Clojure is based on CIDER and adds ‘clj-refactor’
a refactoring layer built on top of CIDER.  The refactoring keybinding
prefix is set to ‘C-c r’ to avoid conflicts with CIDER.  To change this
to something else (for example ‘C-c C-m’ as mentioned on the github
page) use the following snippet:

     (clj-add-keybindings-with-prefix "C-c C-m")


File: rational-emacs.info,  Node: Scheme/Racket,  Prev: Clojure,  Up: Rational Emacs Lisp Module

6.4.5 Scheme/Racket
-------------------

Geiser provides a modular package for the Scheme family of languages
including Racket.  There are several modules availble for Geiser.  We
provide the configuration for Guile and Racket, but others can be added,
see the Commentary section for this module to see a list of other
modules, or look for them by running ‘M-x list-packages’ and seaching
for ‘geiser’.

   When visiting a scheme file, use ‘M-x gieser-run’ to start a REPL.
Alternatively, you can use ‘M-x geiser-guile’ or ‘M-x
geiser-racket-connect’.

   If you have installed multiple scheme implementations, you may wish
to set the ‘scheme-program-name’ variable, which we default to "guile"
to match the configuration for that implementation.  To change this to
‘scheme’ for example, use this snippet:

     (customize-set-variable 'scheme-program-name "scheme")

6.6 Rational Emacs Project Module
=================================

To use this module, simply require it in your config.

     (require 'rational-project)

   This module uses Emacs’ built-in project backend (often referred to
as ‘project.el’).

   Most of the default keybindings are prefixed by "C-x p".  See the
Emacs Manual
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Projects.html)
for details.

   • Project List File

     The project backend uses a list of known projects.  In Rational
     Emacs, it is called called ‘projects’ by default and resides in the
     ‘var’ directory of your user config directory, e.g.

        • ‘~/.rational-emacs/var/projects’
        • ‘~/.config/rational-emacs/var/projects’

     You can edit this file if necessary, but probably the most usual
     use case would be to remove a project from the list.  For that, you
     can also run the ‘project-forget-project’ function.

6.7 Rational Emacs Python Module
================================

This module installs a few additional packages to configure an IDE-like
environment for Python development.  In addition to the packages
installed, you must also install a few Python modules.  To use this
module, simply require it in your config.

* Suggested keybindings::


File: rational-emacs.info,  Node: Packages Installed (1),  Next: Provided configuration (1),  Up: Rational Emacs Python Module

6.7.1 Packages Installed
------------------------

   • ‘anaconda-mode’

     This mode provides code navigation, documentation and completion.

   • ‘blacken’

     This mode is used to format your Python code on-save.  You also
     need to install the ‘black’ package with ‘pip’:

          pip install black

   • ‘eglot’

     This is the language server provider, it will connect to an
     installed language server for completions, refactoring and other
     features.  You also need to install the ‘pyright’ package with
     ‘pip’:

          pip install pyright

   • ‘numpydoc’

     This package provides templates for creating Python documentation
     (aka pydoc).

   • ‘pyvenv’

     This package wraps Python virtual environments.  It is used to
     activate specific environments for each Python project.


File: rational-emacs.info,  Node: Provided configuration (1),  Next: Suggested keybindings,  Prev: Packages Installed (1),  Up: Rational Emacs Python Module

6.7.2 Provided configuration
----------------------------

‘anaconda-mode-installation-directory’ is set to the
‘rational-config-var-directory’.  This is where anaconda-mode will
install the python files it uses for completion and documentation.

   ‘anaconda-mode-use-posframe-show-doc’ is set to ‘t’ when the
‘posframe’ package is installed and ‘posframe’ has been turned on.  The
assumption is you prefer to use ‘posframe’ for popups, so enable it with
anaconda-mode.

   ‘pyvenv-restart-python’ is added to the ‘pyvenv-post-activate-hooks’
to enable restarting the Python interpreter when switching buffers to
another project.

   ‘python-indent-guess-indent-offset-verbose’ is set to ‘nil’ which
turns off emitting a warning when indentation guessing fails.

   ‘numpydoc-insert-examples-block’ is set to ‘nil’ to turn off adding
an "Examples" block when creating the template.

   ‘numpydoc-template-long’ is set to ‘nil’ to turn off adding a "FIXME:
Long description" block when creating the template.

   For more information on each of these, you can review the docstrings
with each variable.

6.7.3 Suggested keybindings
---------------------------

No keybindings are provided, but we do offer the following suggestions.

   Using the ‘with-eval-after-load’ form defers loading the keybindings
until the module is loaded (either "python" or "pyvenv" in this case).

     (with-eval-after-load "python"
       (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-n") #'numpydoc-generate)
       (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c e n") #'flymake-goto-next-error)
       (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c e p") #'flymake-goto-prev-error))

     (with-eval-after-load "pyvenv"
       (define-key pyvenv-mode-map (kbd "C-c p a") #'pyvenv-activate)
       (define-key pyvenv-mode-map (kbd "C-c p d") #'pyvenv-deactivate)
       (define-key pyvenv-mode-map (kbd "C-c p w") #'pyvenv-workon))

6.8.2 Description
-----------------


This module installs and sets up four packages to emulate and extend
Vim’s (https://www.vim.org/) modal editing model.

   • Evil (https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil): A minor mode that adds
     Vim-like modal editing, visual selection, and text objects to Emacs
   • Evil-collection (https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection):
     Vim-like bindings for modes not covered by default in Evil
   • Undo-tree: Visualizes changes made in your file as a tree
   • Evil-nerd-commenter
     (https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-nerd-commenter): Allows easy
     commenting of code for many different file types.

   More information can be found about each of these packages on their
respective pages linked above.

   If this module is included in your configuration file, evil-mode,
along with evil-collection and evil-nerd-commenter will be enabled by
default.  To toggle evil-mode on or off run ‘M-x evil-mode’.

   The undo history of a file can be visualized using ‘M-x
undo-tree-visualize’ which is bound by default to ‘C-x u’.  The history
can then be navigated through using the arrow keys.


File: rational-emacs.info,  Node: Customization Variables,  Next: Some default settings,  Prev: Description,  Up: Rational Emacs Evil Module

6.8.3 Customization Variables
-----------------------------

This module provides two customizable variables

   • ‘rational-evil-discourage-arrow-keys’
   • ‘rational-evil-vim-muscle-memory’.

   When ‘rational-evil-discourage-arrow-keys’ is true, arrow keys are
disabled in normal and visual mode.  When you attempt to use the arrow
keys a message will pop up reminding you to use the ‘HJKL’ keys instead.

   When ‘rational-evil-vim-muscle-memory’ is true, the variables
‘evil-want-C-i-jump’, ‘evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol’, and
‘evil-want-fine-undo’ are all set to true.  By default, they are nil.
Setting these to true allows Evil to overwrite some of the default Emacs
keybindings to allow for a more Vim-like experience.

   Setting ‘evil-want-C-i-jump’ to true sets ‘C-i’ to jump forward, as
in Vim.  The default behavior is to insert a tab character.

   When ‘evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol’ is true ‘Y’ yanks to the end of the
line.  The default behavior if to yank the whole line.

   Finally, setting ‘evil-want-fine-undo’ to true allows an action, such
as an insert, to be broken into separate steps.  For example, if, while
in the insert state, you performed a delete operation after a change
operation setting this variable to true would allow it to be undone in
multiple steps.  If it is set to nil then an action, like the one
described above, will be undone all at once.

   Each package this module installs might have additional variables
that can be modified to change its behavior.  Please refer to the
documentation for those packages for more information.

6.8.4 Some default settings
---------------------------

For your convenience, the following settings have been set by default.

   • ‘evil-respect-visual-line-mode’ is set to t, causing Evil’s motion
     commands to act on visual lines rather than logical lines.
   • The following modes are set to open up in Emacs state (using Emacs’
     default keybindings) when they start
        • custom-mode
        • eshell-mode
        • term-mode
   • The following keybindings have been added

     Key-Chord   Function                               Keymap
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     ‘C-g’       ‘evil-normal-state’                    ‘evil-insert-state-map’
     ‘C-M-u’     ‘universal-argument’                   ‘current-global-map’
     ‘C-h’       ‘evil-delete-backward-char-and-join’   ‘evil-insert-state-map’
     ‘j’         ‘evil-next-visual-line’                ‘evil-motion-state-map’
     ‘k’         ‘evil-previous-visual-line’            ‘evil-motion-state-map’
This module enables winner-mode
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Window-Convenience.html)
and provides a set of keybindings that help you navigate through
multiple windows.

   ‘winner-mode’ is a minor mode that, when activated, allows you to
revert to a prior windows arrangement.  It provides two functions to
allow this: ‘winner-undo’ and ‘winner-redo’.  These take you to earlier
and later windows arrangements respectively.

   A new keymap is created, ‘rational-windows-key-map’, to store the
keybindings associated with this module.  Additionally, this module
defines a custom variable, ‘rational-windows-prefix-key’, which allows
you to set the prefix key to the keymap.  By default, this is set to
‘C-c w’, but you are free to change it.

   Using the default prefix-key, the keybindings defined in this module
are

Key Chord   Function         Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------
C-c w u     winner-undo      Reverts to the previous windows layout
C-c w n     windmove-down    Moves point to window below
C-c w p     windmove-up      Moves point to window above
C-c w b     windmove-left    Moves point to window to the left
C-c w f     windmove-right   Moves point to window to the right

7 Troubleshooting
*****************

Some tips when things don’t seem to work right.

* Menu:

* A package (suddenly?) fails to work::


File: rational-emacs.info,  Node: A package (suddenly?) fails to work,  Up: Troubleshooting

7.1 A package (suddenly?) fails to work
=======================================

This scenario happened frequently when upgading to Emacs 28.  It also
may occur in other scenarios as well.  Usually, you will see some
message indicating some symbol is void or some function or command does
not exist.  More often than not, the package maintainer is using a
feature from another package which has not yet been released.  The new
feature is available in the development version of the package however.

   Here are some example issues where things went wrong:
   • Wrong number of arguments error
     (https://github.com/SystemCrafters/rational-emacs/issues/126)
   • Example config doesn’t start
     (https://github.com/SystemCrafters/rational-emacs/issues/132)
   • there are some bugs in package "helpful"
     (https://github.com/SystemCrafters/rational-emacs/issues/140)

   Here are some strategies:

   • Check the code on the package source control page (ie GitHub,
     GitLab or whatever), and make sure the missing code is present on
     the ‘master’ branch.
   • Look at the code associated with the released version (you need to
     look at the most recent tag for this).  If the code is missing
     there, ask the maintainer for a new release.  Often, there are
     years between releases of Emacs packages, but that depends
     completely on the package maintainer.  Some of them release more
     frequently, others only on request.

   Once you have done the steps above, you can choose to take one of
these actions in your configuration:

   • Option 1
        • Use ‘M-x package-list-packages’ to display the list of
          packages.
        • Find the package in the list which doesn’t work for you, it
          will have either the _installed_ or _dependency_ status.
        • Press the ‘enter’ key to get more details on the package an
          look near the bottom of the metadata, you should see a line
          with "Other Versions".  Choose the development version - it
          will have a version number that looks like a date and the text
          ‘(melpa)’ next to it.  Press ‘enter’ on this version.
        • Following the step above will take you to the same package but
          from the MELPA repository, and you’ll see a button at the top
          labeled ‘Install’.  Click this button.
        • *Optionally* you can go back to the list of packages, find
          previous installed version, press the letter ’D’ and then the
          letter ’X’ to uninstall that version.
        • Restart Emacs
   • Option 2
        • Edit your ‘early-config.el’ file.
        • Near the bottom, add a line similar to this to pin the
          offending package to MELPA (make sure to replace
          _package-name_ with the name of the actual package):

               (add-to-list 'package-pinned-packages (cons 'package-name "melpa"))

        • Use ‘M-x package-list-packages’ to display the list of
          packages.
        • Find the package in the list, press the letter ’D’ and the
          letter ’X’ to uninstall that package.
        • Restart Emacs, the package should be installed from MELPA thus
          using the development version of the package instead of the
          released version.

   Regardless, always feel free to open an issue here and we can help
you out.  Please be as complete as possible in your description of the
problem.  Include any stack traces Emacs provides (ie start Emacs with:
‘emacs --debug-init’), mention the version number of the package you are
installing, and anything you might have tried but which didn’t work for
you.
