* Contributing documentation

  The documentation provided here is written in Org mode files. The
  primary file is the =crafted-emacs.org= file. Each module has it's
  own Org file as well, but each is included in the primary file.

  To export the org file to an info file, run the following command:
  =M-x org-texinfo-export-to-info RET=. To use the org export
  interface to reach this function, make sure to first run:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'ox-texinfo)
  #+end_src

  Then you can use =C-c C-e i= to export to info.

* Documenting a Crafted Emacs module

  Add an Org file named for the module. Once you are ready to include
  it in the =crafted-emacs.org= file, add it to the modules section
  following the pattern provided there, here is an example:

  #+begin_example
    ,#+include: crafted-defaults.org
  #+end_example

  Once you have added the module documentation, export the info file
  and submit a PR for inclusion.

* Guidelines

  + Make sure your grammar is correct.
  + Spellcheck your work.
  + Preview the info document in Emacs to make sure the formatting
    works.
  + Use =@@texinfo:@code{}@@= or =@@texinfo:@samp{}@@= tags in
    headers, captions, or other places where org formatting does not
    directly translate correctly.
  + Provide examples.
