Hacking one's Emacs configuration is, for some, an ongoing
endeavor. For others, it just needs to work. Other configuration
packages attempt to be a complete, canned, working configuration,
while Crafted attempts to provide the bare minimum to get you
started. More like a framework than a complete solution, Crafted
Emacs intends to provide a sensible place to start configuring your
Emacs to your needs.

Defaults provided here were provided by a community of volunteers and
ideally represent sane defaults from which to start. We expect you to
have different opinions than ours and we expect you to implement those
differences in your own configuration. Our intent is to provide
something you might find useful to get your started on your own
Emacs configuration journey.

* Principles

  This configuration and all associated modules intend to follow these
  principles:

  - Minimal, modular configuration

    + The core configuration only sets up Emacs to have a cleaner
      presentation with sensible defaults. It is up to the user to
      decide which modules to load and when to load them.

    + Modules should not depend on other modules as much as
      possible. When a module needs to integrate with other
      functionality in Emacs, the standard extensibility points of
      each package should be used. The implication is someone should
      be able to copy code from a module into their own configuration
      /without/ using Crafted Emacs.

  - Prioritize built-in Emacs functionality

    Where possible, we will leverage built-in Emacs functionality
    instead of external packages.

    Some of the packages we prefer:

    + =project.el= for project management.

    + =tab-bar-mode= for organizing groups of buffers.

    + =whitespace.el= to cleanup whitespace, like tabs, newlines or
      additional space added to the end of lines.

    + =pulse.el= to flash the current line under certain conditions.

    + And others...

    This is not to take away from the amazing work package providers
    have contributed to the Emacs community. By prioritizing built-in
    features, we can highlight less known packages, have a more stable
    product, and reduce the amount of network load just to get
    started. Indeed, if you do not pull in any of the modules we
    provide, you may not even need a network (other than to clone the
    repo from GitHub).

  - Works well in the terminal

    Not everyone uses a windowing environment, and the terminal is
    popular for remote sessions as well as command line
    utilities. Working well in the terminal also enables the use of
    Emacs in Termux on Android!

  - Can be integrated with a Guix configuration

    GNU Guix is a functional package manager and GNU Linux
    distribution. This integration enables setting things like font
    sizes, themes, etc in a system-specific and repeatable way.

  - Works well with =Chemacs2=

    Having multiple configurations available allows for testing
    individual package combinations or configurations from
    others. =Chemacs2= allows for having multiple configurations
    simultaneously and Crafted Emacs should work well in this
    environment also.

  - Helps you learn Emacs Lisp

    Instead of providing a higher-level configuration system out of
    the box like other Emacs configurations (like Doom or Spacemacs
    for example), we follow standard Emacs Lisp patterns so you can
    learn by reading the configuration. This means we don't provide
    macro wrappers around packaging and configuration tools. No
    complex framework exists.

* Why use it?

  Why choose this configuration over /Doom Emacs/, /Spacemacs/,
  /Prelude/, or others?

  The goal of this configuration is to make it easier to write your
  own Emacs configuration while using pre-made configuration parts
  maintained by the community. Instead of using a monolithic,
  all-encompassing approach, we strive to ensure that all parts of
  this configuration are optional or interchangeable.

  You should even be able to use the configuration modules we provide
  with your own =init.el= file without using this base configuration
  repo!

* Folder structure

  There are two primary folders for working with Crafted Emacs:

  - `user-emacs-directory` (ie: `~/.config/emacs`) where Emacs, by default, searches for its configuration, packages, etc.
  - `crafted-config-path` (ie: `~/.config/crafted-emacs`, see below) where Crafted Emacs searches for everything except packages.

  By default Crafted Emacs does not do much regarding those paths except for customizations as introduced below.

  The `crafted-config-path` layout is designed following current common practices to help you keep configuration and runtime data separatedly (inside `etc/` and `var/` respectively).

  Moreover, the [[file:crafted-defaults.org#sensible-path-defaults][crafted-defaults]] module sets several common default
  paths to sensible new defaults following such practices.

  We do not, yet, provide a cache path here as that needs further thought (most OS expect caches in specific places).

* Customization

  To add your own customization to this configuration, create a
  configuration file in one of the following places:

  - =~/.crafted-emacs/=
  - =~/.config/crafted-emacs/=

  In your configuration you can set any Emacs configuration variable,
  face attributes, themes, etc as you normally would.

  If you prefer to explicitly control where your =config.el= and
  =early-config.el= are found for Crafted Emacs, you may provide a
  value for the =CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME= environment variable, either on
  the command line or in your shell configuration. This variable
  should only contain the path to the =config.el= files, for example:

  #+caption: Set environment variable @@texinfo:@code{CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME}@@ to the path of the configuration directory.
  #+begin_src shell
    CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME=~/my-crafted-emacs-config
  #+end_src

** Managing packages

   #+include: crafted-package.org

** How the crafted config file is found

   The crafted config files (=config.el= and =early-config.el=) are
   found in the =crafted-config-path=. That path will match exactly
   one of the following scenarios, in the order specified:

  - Using =Chemacs2= (See below for more on this)
    - The environment variable =CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME= is used if provided in the
      profile definition.
    - The profile directory is used when no environment variable is provided in
      the profile definition.
  - Use the value found in the =CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME= environment variable.
  - The environment variable =XDG_CONFIG_HOME= is present or the path
    =$HOME/.config/crafted-emacs= exists.
    - These normally resolve to the same file, so build the path from the
      =XDG_CONFIG_HOME= environment variable or the explicit path
      =~/.config/crafted-emacs=
  - Use the =HOME= environment variable to make the path, which expands to
    =$HOME/.crafted-emacs=.

  Once the =crafted-config-path= is determined, if it does not exist
  in the file system, it is created. However, just the path is
  created, the files =config.el= and =early-config.el= must be created
  by you.

** Example Configuration:

  #+caption: Example of user created Crafted Emacs @@texinfo:@code{config.el}@@ file.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'crafted-defaults)
    (require 'crafted-screencast)
    (require 'crafted-ui)
    (require 'crafted-editing)
    (require 'crafted-evil)
    (require 'crafted-completion)
    (require 'crafted-windows)

    ;; Set further font and theme customizations
    (custom-set-variables
     '(crafted-ui-default-font
       '(:font "JetBrains Mono" :weight light :height 185)))

    (crafted-package-install-package 'doom-themes)
    (load-theme 'doom-one t)
  #+end_src

  See the =examples= folder in the git-repo for more up to date and comprehensive
  examples.

** The =custom.el= file

   The =custom.el= file will hold the auto-generated code from the Emacs
   Customization UI.

*** Simplified overview of how Emacs Customization works

    Customizable values are defined with the =defcustom= form, and can be
    customized using the Easy Customization UI. A complete discussion is out of
    scope for this document, instead see the Emacs Manual for more information.

    There are several states a value can be in, for our purposes, we will only
    consider two of them: the default state and the changed state. These are not
    the "official" names but easily convey the concepts of the variable. If a
    value is in the default state, looking in the Customization UI, the state
    will be listed as =STANDARD=. Crafted Emacs takes the approach of using the
    =customize-set-variable= to update the values defined with
    =defcustom=. This will show the values as =SET for current session only= in
    the Customization UI. This is normal since the values are set each time
    Emacs starts. They are technically "SAVED" since they exist as emacs-lisp
    code, but since they are not in a =custom-set-variables= form the
    Customization UI only sees them as "SET for the current session only".

    A =SAVED and set= value means the Customization code has written the
    configuration to disk to be loaded again the next time Emacs starts. When
    Emacs saves the configuration from the Customization UI, it simply adds a
    couple of forms to the end of your initialization file (typically
    =init.el=), with comments warning about having more than one form with the
    same name (see example below).

*** Loading the =custom.el= file

    This is important because if you, the user, wish to use the Customization
    UI to configure Emacs, the customizations will (by default) be written to
    the bottom of the =init.el= file in a form called =custom-set-variables= and
    =custom-set-faces=. These are loaded usually at the end of the init cycle
    (which is why they are listed at the bottom of the =init.el= file) and
    allows restoring values set by the Customization UI rather than through
    code.

    This configuration sets the =custom-file= to exist in the
    =crafted-config-path= (see above) as a file known as =custom.el=. This file
    is *not* automatically loaded by Crafted Emacs configuration. You may, if
    you choose, load this file yourself with the following code in your
    =config.el= file.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (load "custom")
    #+end_src

    It is important to load this file last to make sure it overrides any values
    previously set while Emacs was starting.

    If you are using something like the example provided above, you might have
    something that looks more like this:

    #+name: config.el
    #+caption: Example @@texinfo:@samp{config.el}@@ loading the @@texinfo:@code{custom.el}@@ file.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (require 'crafted-defaults)
      (require 'crafted-screencast)
      (require 'crafted-ui)
      (require 'crafted-editing)
      (require 'crafted-evil)
      (require 'crafted-completion)
      (require 'crafted-windows)

      (crafted-package-install-package 'doom-themes)
      (load-theme 'doom-one t)

      (load "custom")
      ;;; example-config.el ends here
    #+end_src

    And then in =custom.el= you would have something like the following which
    is auto-generated by Emacs:

    #+name: custom.el
    #+caption: Example auto-generated @@texinfo:@code{custom.el}@@ file.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (custom-set-variables
       ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
       ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
       ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
       ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
       '(crafted-ui-default-font '(:font "JetBrains Mono" :weight light :height 185))
       '(crafted-ui-display-line-numbers t))
      (custom-set-faces
       ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
       ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
       ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
       ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
       )
    #+end_src


*** Not loading the =custom.el= file

    You may choose not to load the =custom.el= file if you are writing your own
    configuration with Emacs-Lisp. Using =customize-set-variable= has the same
    effect as using the Customization UI, with the primary difference, the
    customization is not written later as if you had used the Customization
    UI. If you choose to follow this pattern, you will not need to load the
    =custom.el= file ever. Our example (see above) could imply the use of the
    Customization UI, as our example uses the =custom-set-variables= form to set
    a list of customizable values all at once. Here is the same example written
    differently.

    #+caption: Example @@texinfo:@samp{config.el}@@ setting customization variables directly.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (require 'crafted-defaults)
      (require 'crafted-screencast)
      (require 'crafted-ui)
      (require 'crafted-editing)
      (require 'crafted-evil)
      (require 'crafted-completion)
      (require 'crafted-windows)

      (customize-set-variable 'crafted-ui-default-font
                              '(:font "JetBrains Mono" :weight light :height 185))
      (customize-set-variable 'crafted-ui-display-line-numbers t)

      (crafted-package-install-package 'doom-themes)
      (load-theme 'doom-one t)
    #+end_src

*** Caveat on the timing of loading =custom.el=

    Even if you are using emacs-lisp to customize Emacs, you may still choose to
    load the =custom.el= file. Keep in mind, if you use =customize-set-variable=
    or =setq= to set the value for a =defcustom= option and then load the
    =custom.el= file which might have the same variable set with a different
    value, the last thing to set that value wins.

    Here is an example, first a =config.el= snippet:

    #+name: config.el
    #+caption: @@texinfo:@samp{config.el}@@ snippet loading @@texinfo:@code{custom.el}@@ last
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; ... some customization before
      (customize-set-variable 'display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
      ;; ... some more customization

      (load "custom")
    #+end_src

    and the =custom.el= snippet

    #+name: custom.el
    #+caption: @@texinfo:@code{custom.el}@@ snippet.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (custom-set-variables
       '(display-line-numbers-type t))
    #+end_src

    The value of the =display-line-numbers-type= will be =t=. Since the
    =custom.el= file is loaded _last_ the first value of the
    =display-line-numbers-type= is overwritten. The fix is to make sure you set
    the value only once in your configuration with either
    =customize-set-variable= or with =custom-set-variables= either in your
    =config.el= or loaded from =custom.el=

* Using it with =Chemacs2=

  If you have the =Chemacs2= configuration cloned to =~/.emacs.d= or
  =~/.config/emacs=, you can clone =crafted-emacs= anywhere you like
  and add an entry to it in your =~/.emacs-profiles.el= file:

  You can then put your =early-config.el= and =config.el= files in the
  sub-folder =~/path/to/crafted-emacs/crafted-emacs=. So, for example
  if you installed Crafted Emacs to =~/.crafted-emacs=, then your
  =early-config.el= and =config.el= files would be in the path
  =~/.crafted-emacs/crafted-emacs=. This is the default path, but
  you can change the name to something else, see below for examples.

  #+caption: Example of a @@texinfo:@samp{Chemacs2}@@ user profile file in @@texinfo:@code{~/.emacs-profiles.el}@@.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (("crafted" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/path/to/crafted-emacs"))))

  #+end_src

  If you prefer to put your Crafted Emacs customizations elsewhere
  (for example in a folder called `config` or maybe `personal`), you
  can specify the =CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME= environment variable, for
  example like this:

  #+caption: User @@texinfo:@samp{Chemacs2}@@ profile file @@texinfo:@code{~/.emacs-profiles.el}@@ with environment variable.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

      (("crafted" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/path/to/crafted-emacs")
                      (env . (("CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME" . "~/path/to/crafted-emacs/personal"))))))

  #+end_src

  Or some place completely different:

  #+caption: User @@texinfo:@samp{Chemacs2}@@ profile file @@texinfo:@code{~/.emacs-profiles.el}@@ with Crafted Emacs config files set to another path.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

      (("crafted" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/path/to/crafted-emacs")
                      (env . (("CRAFTED_EMACS_HOME" . "~/crafted-config/personal"))))))

  #+end_src


  Then launch it with =emacs --with-profile crafted=!

* Modules

  Crafted Emacs includes a number of modules to further configure
  Emacs. These are intended to be stand-alone in the sense that no
  module requires the use of any other module.

  The modules are written to support various themes: mini-buffer
  selection (completion), editing, ui, etc. To use these modules,
  simply =require= them in your =config.el=, or copy the relevant
  portions to your =config.el= and modify them to suit your needs.

  In most cases, you can =require= the module, and then adjust the
  configuration for specific parts by overriding the settings provided
  by the module by additional code in your =config.el=.

  While the intent here is to document each module as completely as
  reasonably possible, the best-practice is to simply read the code
  for the module of interest to understand it best.

* Troubleshooting

  Some tips when things don't seem to work right.

** A package (suddenly?) fails to work

   This scenario happened frequently when upgading to Emacs 28. It also may
   occur in other scenarios as well. Usually, you will see some message
   indicating some symbol is void or some function or command does not
   exist. More often than not, the package maintainer is using a feature from
   another package which has not yet been released. The new feature is available
   in the development version of the package however.

   Here are some example issues where things went wrong:
   - [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/126][Wrong number of arguments error]]
   - [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/132][Example config doesn't start]]
   - [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/140][there are some bugs in package "helpful"]]

   Here are some strategies:

   - Check the code on the package source control page (ie GitHub, GitLab or
     whatever), and make sure the missing code is present on the =master=
     branch.
   - Look at the code associated with the released version (you need to look at
     the most recent tag for this). If the code is missing there, ask the
     maintainer for a new release. Often, there are years between releases of
     Emacs packages, but that depends completely on the package maintainer. Some
     of them release more frequently, others only on request.

   Once you have done the steps above, you can choose to take one of these
   actions in your configuration:

   - Option 1
     + Use =M-x package-list-packages= to display the list of packages.
     + Find the package in the list which doesn't work for you, it will have
       either the /installed/ or /dependency/ status.
     + Press the =enter= key to get more details on the package an look near the
       bottom of the metadata, you should see a line with "Other Versions". Choose
       the development version - it will have a version number that looks like a
       date and the text =(melpa)= next to it. Press =enter= on this version.
     + Following the step above will take you to the same package but from the
       MELPA repository, and you'll see a button at the top labeled
       =Install=. Click this button.
     + *Optionally* you can go back to the list of packages, find previous
       installed version, press the letter 'D' and then the letter 'X' to
       uninstall that version.
     + Restart Emacs
   - Option 2
     + Edit your =early-config.el= file.
     + Near the bottom, add a line similar to this to pin the offending package
       to MELPA (make sure to replace /package-name/ with the name of the actual
       package):

       #+begin_src emacs-lisp
         (add-to-list 'package-pinned-packages (cons 'package-name "melpa"))
       #+end_src

     + Use =M-x package-list-packages= to display the list of packages.
     + Find the package in the list, press the letter 'D' and the letter 'X' to
       uninstall that package.
     + Restart Emacs, the package should be installed from MELPA thus using the
       development version of the package instead of the released version.

   Regardless, always feel free to open an issue here and we can help you
   out. Please be as complete as possible in your description of the
   problem. Include any stack traces Emacs provides (ie start Emacs with: =emacs
   --debug-init=), mention the version number of the package you are installing,
   and anything you might have tried but which didn't work for you.
