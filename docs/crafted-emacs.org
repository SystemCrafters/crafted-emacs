Hacking one's Emacs configuration is, for some, an ongoing
endeavor. For others, it just needs to work. Other configuration
packages attempt to be a complete, canned, working configuration,
while Crafted attempts to provide the bare minimum to get you
started. More like a framework than a complete solution, Crafted
Emacs intends to provide a sensible place to start configuring your
Emacs to your needs.

Defaults provided here were provided by a community of volunteers and
ideally represent sane defaults from which to start. We expect you to
have different opinions than ours and we expect you to implement those
differences in your own configuration. Our intent is to provide
something you might find useful to get you started on your own Emacs
configuration journey.  

* Goals
   + No new configuration system, macros, layers etc.  Almost
     everything is straight Emacs Lisp.
   + Provide some pre-configured modules to shorten the time it takes to build a
     nice working configuration.
   + Customizations in the modules we provide should be _opt-in_ by
     default to avoid surprising behavior.
   + Not a turn-key/kitchen sink solution. There will be holes the
     user must fill.
   + Fewer packages rather than more; we prefer to stay closer to built-in
     functionality as much as possible.
   + Correctness is important, as we expect people who might be new to
     Emacs Lisp to learn from what we have written.  We prefer
     ~customize-set-variable~ instead of ~setq~ for ~defcustom~ values as an
     example.
   + Documentation is thorough, complete, and easy to find.  There is an [[info:crafted-emacs][info]]
     manual for Crafted Emacs distributed with the source.
* Principles
** Minimal, modular configuration

The core configuration only sets up Emacs to have a cleaner
presentation with sensible defaults. It is up to the user to decide
which ~crafted-*~ modules to load.

Configuration modules depend on other modules and the base configuration
as little as possible.

The implication is that someone should be able to install or copy code
from a ~crafted-*~ module into their own configuration /without/ using
Crafted Emacs.

** Prioritize built-in Emacs functionality

Where possible, we leverage built-in Emacs functionality instead of
external packages.  When we choose external packages, we prefer those
which are layered on top of existing, built-in, functionality.  For
example:

- ~project.el~ instead of ~Projectile~
- ~tab-bar-mode~ instead of ~Perspective.el~, ~persp-mode~, ~eyebrowse~, etc
- ~eglot~ instead of ~lsp-mode~ (because ~eglot~ prioritizes built-in
  functionality in Emacs 28, and is built-in with Emacs 29)

** Can be integrated with a Guix configuration

It should be possible to customize aspects of the Crafted Emacs
configuration inside of a Guix Home configuration so that things like
font sizes, themes, etc can be system-specific.

It can also use packages installed via the Guix package manager
instead of ~package.el~.

** Helps you learn Emacs Lisp

Instead of providing a higher-level configuration system out of the
box like other Emacs configurations, we follow standard Emacs Lisp
patterns so that you can learn by reading the configuration.  We do
our best to provide clear comments where necessary to help the reader
understand our choices and how the code works.

** Reversible

We recognize not everyone will agree with our decisions, so each
customization should be easily reversible in the users configuration
file.

* Why use it?

  Why choose this configuration over /Doom Emacs/, /Spacemacs/,
  /Prelude/, or others?

  The goal of this configuration is to make it easier to write your
  own Emacs configuration while using pre-made configuration parts
  maintained by the community. Instead of using a monolithic,
  all-encompassing approach, we strive to ensure that all parts of
  this configuration are optional or interchangeable.

  You should even be able to use the configuration modules we provide
  with your own =init.el= file without using this base configuration
  repo!

* Getting Started

Welcome to Crafted Emacs.

This section provides introductory material for setting up Crafted Emacs.
We'll approach this from the perspective of the brand new Emacs user.

If you are already familiar with Emacs, you'll be able to skim this guide
for the code examples.

#+include: getting-started-guide.org

* Customization

** Using alternate package managers

  Not everyone will prefer to use Emacs' built-in package manager, ~package.el~.
  Using the package bundle modules from Crafted Emacs is still possible,
  however, you will potentially need to iterate over the
  ~package-selected-packages~ list to perform the install for your package
  manager. To help with that, the ~crafted-package-config~ module provides a
  variable to set and a function to call.

  Here is an example using ~straight-use-package~ as the tool to install
  packages. The following lines must be called before any package is installed
  (preferable in =early-init.el=):

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (load (expand-file-name "modules/crafted-package-config" crafted-emacs-home))
 
    (setq crafted-package-installer #'straight-use-package)
    (setq crafted-package-installed-predicate #'straight--installed-p)
  #+end_src

  In your =init.el= you have to call ~crafted-package-install-selected-packages~
  instead of ~package-install-selected-packages~, after adding your packages to
  ~package-selected-packages~.

  Note: This usage is simple in the sense full recipes are not used when using
  Crafted Emacs package bundle modules. The above essentially runs code like the
  following:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (straight-use-package 'corfu)
  #+end_src

  You find a full example [[file:../examples/crafted-early-init-straight.el][crafted-early-init-straight.el]] to bootstrap straight
  in the examples directory. Merge it into your =early-init.el= or copy it to your
  =custom-modules= folder. In the later case =early-init.el= would look like
  this:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq crafted-emacs-home "~/crafted-emacs")

  (load (expand-file-name "custom-modules/crafted-early-init-straight"
                          user-emacs-directory))
  #+end_src

  It is not required to use the Crafted Emacs package bundle modules, you are
  free to install packages in whatever manner you choose, for example, using
  ~guix-home~ to install Emacs packages from the Guix Store. Similarly, using
  ~straight~, ~elpaca~, ~package-vc~ or others can be used to install any packages you
  choose. Once your packages are installed, you can then use the Crafted Emacs
  configuration modules. These modules have names like
  ~crafted-completion-config.el~ for example. Add these to your =init.el= *after*
  installing packages.

** The =custom.el= file

   The =custom.el= file will hold the auto-generated code from the Emacs
   Customization UI.

*** Simplified overview of how Emacs Customization works

    Customizable values are defined with the ~defcustom~ form, and can be
    customized using the Easy Customization UI. A complete discussion is out of
    scope for this document, instead see the Emacs Manual for more information.

    There are several states a value can be in, for our purposes, we will only
    consider two of them: the default state and the changed state. These are not
    the "official" names but easily convey the concepts of the variable. If a
    value is in the default state, looking in the Customization UI, the state
    will be listed as =STANDARD=. Crafted Emacs takes the approach of using the
    ~customize-set-variable~ to update the values defined with ~defcustom~. This
    will show the values as =SET for current session only= in the Customization
    UI. This is normal since the values are set each time Emacs starts. They are
    technically "SAVED" since they exist as emacs-lisp code, but since they are
    not in a ~custom-set-variables~ form the Customization UI only sees them as
    "SET for the current session only".

    A =SAVED and set= value means the Customization code has written the
    configuration to disk to be loaded again the next time Emacs starts. When
    Emacs saves the configuration from the Customization UI, it simply adds a
    couple of forms to the end of your initialization file (typically
    =init.el=), with comments warning about having more than one form with the
    same name (see example below).

*** Loading the =custom.el= file

    This is important because if you, the user, wish to use the Customization UI
    to configure Emacs, the customizations will (by default) be written to the
    of the =init.el= file in a form called ~custom-set-variables~ and
    ~custom-set-faces~. 

    This snippet, added to the top of your =init.el= file sets the name of the
    file holding Emacs customizations to be =custom.el= in the same directory
    where your =init.el= file resides.  Additionally, the code checks to see if
    the file exists, and if so, loads it to take advantage of the saved
    configuration therein.
    
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
      (when (and custom-file
                 (file-exists-p custom-file))
        (load custom-file nil :nomessage))
    #+end_src

    This is an example of what the Emacs customization file might look like.
    The values used here are just examples, you may have many more values
    configured than just these.
    
    #+name: custom.el
    #+caption: Example auto-generated =custom.el= file.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (custom-set-variables
       ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
       ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
       ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
       ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
       '(column-number-mode t)
       '(fido-vertical-mode t))
      (custom-set-faces
       ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
       ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
       ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
       ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
       )
    #+end_src

* Contributing

  Follow the [[https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-lisp-style-guide][Elisp Style Guide]] when submitting pull requests.

  This is a community-run modular Emacs configuration, for which we
  appreciate feedback in the form of issues and pull requests. Feel
  free to open an issue prior to opening a pull request if you're not
  certain your idea is in the spirit of the [[Principles][Principles]].

  Specific things we look for are:

   + Prefer ~customize-set-variable~ instead of ~setq~ for ~defcustom~
     values. This helps make sure constructors or setters attached to
     the variable are run when the value is set.
   + Provide ~defcustom~ variables for things we expect the user to
     modify and make sure it is in the appropriate group.
   + Provide verbose doc-strings for ~defvar~, ~defcustom~, ~defun~,
     ~defmacro~, etc to clearly document what is going on.
   + Make sure to follow doc-string guidelines (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Documentation-Tips.html][Documentation Tips]]
     or [[info:elisp#Documentation Tips][elisp#Documentation Tips]])
   + Add comments for blocks of code, especially to describe /why/ the
     code is present, or the intention. These comments serve as
     documentation when reading the code where a doc-string is not an
     option.
   + Add or update documentation in the /docs/ folder. Especially for
     new modules, please provide the info file with your PR. (see
     [[file:docs/CONTRIBUTING.org][Contributing Documentation]])
   + If your PR addresses an issue, whether it closes or fixes the
     issue, or is just related to it, please add the issue number in
     your commit message or the description of your PR so they can be
     linked together.

* Modules
  Crafted Emacs includes a number of modules to further configure
  Emacs. These are intended to be stand-alone in the sense that no
  module requires the use of any other module.

  The modules are written to support various themes, for example mini-buffer
  selection (completion), writing or ui. For how to use them, see the
  [[Getting Started][Getting Started]] section of the manual.

  While the intent here is to document each module as completely as
  reasonably possible, the best-practice is to simply read the code
  for the module of interest to understand it best.

  Module documentation may include additional information on related, popular
  packages and a small example on how to extend your configuration while
  using the same package installation methods as Crafted Emacs.

* Troubleshooting

  Some tips when things don't seem to work right.

** A package (suddenly?) fails to work

   This scenario happened frequently when upgading to Emacs 28. It also may
   occur in other scenarios as well. Usually, you will see some message
   indicating some symbol is void or some function or command does not
   exist. More often than not, the package maintainer is using a feature from
   another package which has not yet been released. The new feature is available
   in the development version of the package however.

   Here are some example issues where things went wrong:
   - [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/126][Wrong number of arguments error]]
   - [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/132][Example config doesn't start]]
   - [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/140][there are some bugs in package "helpful"]]

   Here are some strategies:

   - Check the code on the package source control page (ie GitHub, GitLab or
     whatever), and make sure the missing code is present on the ~master~
     branch.
   - Look at the code associated with the released version (you need to look at
     the most recent tag for this). If the code is missing there, ask the
     maintainer for a new release. Often, there are years between releases of
     Emacs packages, but that depends completely on the package maintainer. Some
     of them release more frequently, others only on request.

   Once you have done the steps above, you can choose to take one of these
   actions in your configuration:

   - Option 1
     + Use =M-x list-packages= to display the list of packages.
     + Find the package in the list which doesn't work for you, it will have
       either the /installed/ or /dependency/ status.
     + Press the =enter= key to get more details on the package an look near the
       bottom of the metadata, you should see a line with "Other Versions". Choose
       the development version - it will have a version number that looks like a
       date and the text =(melpa)= next to it. Press =enter= on this version.
     + Following the step above will take you to the same package but from the
       MELPA repository, and you'll see a button at the top labeled
       =Install=. Click this button.
     + *Optionally* you can go back to the list of packages, find previous
       installed version, press the letter 'D' and then the letter 'X' to
       uninstall that version.
     + Restart Emacs
   - Option 2
     + Edit your =early-config.el= file.
     + Near the bottom, add a line similar to this to pin the offending package
       to MELPA (make sure to replace /package-name/ with the name of the actual
       package):

       #+begin_src emacs-lisp
         (add-to-list 'package-pinned-packages (cons 'package-name "melpa"))
       #+end_src

     + Use =M-x package-list-packages= to display the list of packages.
     + Find the package in the list, press the letter =D= and the letter =X= to
       uninstall that package.
     + Restart Emacs, the package should be installed from MELPA thus using the
       development version of the package instead of the released version.

   Regardless, always feel free to open an issue here and we can help you
   out. Please be as complete as possible in your description of the
   problem. Include any stack traces Emacs provides (ie start Emacs with: =emacs
   --debug-init=), mention the version number of the package you are installing,
   and anything you might have tried but which didn't work for you.
