* Rational Emacs Project Module

  To use this module, simply require it in your config.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'rational-project)
  #+end_src

  This module uses Emacs' built-in project backend (often referred to as
  =project.el=).

  Most of the default keybindings are prefixed by "C-x p". See the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Projects.html][Emacs Manual]]
  for details.
  
  - Project List File

    The project backend uses a list of known projects. In Rational Emacs, it is
    called called =projects= by default and resides in the =var= directory of your
    user config directory, e.g.

    - =~/.rational-emacs/var/projects=
    - =~/.config/rational-emacs/var/projects=

    You can edit this file if necessary, but probably the most usual use case
    would be to remove a project from the list. For that, you can also run
    the =project-forget-project= function.
