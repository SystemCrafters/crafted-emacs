* Crafted Emacs IDE Module

  This module is a generic module which installs and configures Eglot
  for programming modes. This package adds =eglot-ensure= to existing
  loaded programming modes. To use this module, simply require it in
  your config.

** Provided configuration

   =eglot-autoshutdown= is set to =t= to cause Eglot to shutdown the
   language server(s) in use when the last buffer using one is
   killed. Set this to =nil= to keep the LSP servers running.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (customize-set-variable 'eglot-autoshutdown nil)
   #+end_src
