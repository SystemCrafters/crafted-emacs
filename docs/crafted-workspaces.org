* Crafted Workspaces Module

This module installs and sets a basic configuration for [[https://github.com/mclear-tools/tabspaces][tabspaces.el]].

** Provided configuration

=tabspaces-use-filtered-buffers-as-default= is enabled.  This setting
remaps =switch-to-buffer= with =tabspaces-switch-to-buffer=, which uses a
filtered list of buffers in the completion list.

=tabspaces-remove-to-default= is enabled.  Buffers removed from a
tabspace are moved to the default tabspace.

=tabspaces-include-buffers= adds the =*scratch*= buffer to all tabspaces.

** Workarounds

=project--ensure-read-project-list= is called to initialize the project
list; this avoids an error where the dispatch menu causes an error
when =tabspaces-switch-or-create-workspace= is called.  Users can still
select a file or directory when creating the workspace, and the
dispatch still works within the workspace.
