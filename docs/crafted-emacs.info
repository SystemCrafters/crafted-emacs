Crafted Emacs
*************

Hacking one’s Emacs configuration is, for some, an ongoing endeavor.
For others, it just needs to work.  Other configuration packages attempt
to be a complete, canned, working configuration, while Crafted attempts
to provide the bare minimum to get you started.  More like a framework
than a complete solution, Crafted Emacs intends to provide a sensible
place to start configuring your Emacs to your needs.

   Defaults provided here were provided by a community of volunteers and
ideally represent sane defaults from which to start.  We expect you to
have different opinions than ours and we expect you to implement those
differences in your own configuration.  Our intent is to provide
something you might find useful to get you started on your own Emacs
configuration journey.

1 Goals
*******

   • No new configuration system, macros, layers etc.  Almost everything
     is straight Emacs Lisp.
   • Provide some pre-configured modules to shorten the time it takes to
     build a nice working configuration.
   • Customizations in the modules we provide should be opt-in by
     default to avoid surprising behavior.
   • Not a turn-key/kitchen sink solution.  There will be holes the user
     must fill.
   • Fewer packages rather than more; we prefer to stay closer to
     built-in functionality as much as possible.
   • Correctness is important, as we expect people who might be new to
     Emacs Lisp to learn from what we have written.  We prefer
     ‘customize-set-variable’ instead of ‘setq’ for ‘defcustom’ values
     as an example.
   • Documentation is thorough, complete, and easy to find.  There is an
     *note info: (crafted-emacs)Top. manual for Crafted Emacs
     distributed with the source.

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Minimal modular configuration,  Next: Prioritize built-in Emacs functionality,  Up: Principles

2.1 Minimal, modular configuration
==================================

The core configuration only sets up Emacs to have a cleaner presentation
with sensible defaults.  It is up to the user to decide which
‘crafted-*’ modules to load.

   Configuration modules depend on other modules and the base
configuration as little as possible.

   The implication is that someone should be able to install or copy
code from a ‘crafted-*’ module into their own configuration _without_
using Crafted Emacs.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Prioritize built-in Emacs functionality,  Next: Can be integrated with a Guix configuration,  Prev: Minimal modular configuration,  Up: Principles

2.2 Prioritize built-in Emacs functionality
===========================================

Where possible, we leverage built-in Emacs functionality instead of
external packages.  When we choose external packages, we prefer those
which are layered on top of existing, built-in, functionality.  For
example:

   • ‘project.el’ instead of ‘Projectile’
   • ‘tab-bar-mode’ instead of ‘Perspective.el’, ‘persp-mode’,
     ‘eyebrowse’, etc
   • ‘eglot’ instead of ‘lsp-mode’ (because ‘eglot’ prioritizes built-in
     functionality in Emacs 28, and is built-in with Emacs 29)


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Can be integrated with a Guix configuration,  Next: Helps you learn Emacs Lisp,  Prev: Prioritize built-in Emacs functionality,  Up: Principles

2.3 Can be integrated with a Guix configuration
===============================================

It should be possible to customize aspects of the Crafted Emacs
configuration inside of a Guix Home configuration so that things like
font sizes, themes, etc can be system-specific.

   It can also use packages installed via the Guix package manager
instead of ‘package.el’.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Helps you learn Emacs Lisp,  Next: Reversible,  Prev: Can be integrated with a Guix configuration,  Up: Principles

2.4 Helps you learn Emacs Lisp
==============================

Instead of providing a higher-level configuration system out of the box
like other Emacs configurations, we follow standard Emacs Lisp patterns
so that you can learn by reading the configuration.  We do our best to
provide clear comments where necessary to help the reader understand our
choices and how the code works.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Reversible,  Prev: Helps you learn Emacs Lisp,  Up: Principles

2.5 Reversible
==============

We recognize not everyone will agree with our decisions, so each
customization should be easily reversible in the users configuration
file.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Why use it?,  Next: Getting Started,  Prev: Principles,  Up: Top

3 Why use it?
*************

Why choose this configuration over _Doom Emacs_, _Spacemacs_, _Prelude_,
or others?

   The goal of this configuration is to make it easier to write your own
Emacs configuration while using pre-made configuration parts maintained
by the community.  Instead of using a monolithic, all-encompassing
approach, we strive to ensure that all parts of this configuration are
optional or interchangeable.

   You should even be able to use the configuration modules we provide
with your own ‘init.el’ file without using this base configuration repo!

4 Getting Started
*****************

Welcome to _Crafted Emacs_.

   This section provides introductory material for setting up _Crafted
Emacs_.  We’ll approach this from the perspective of the brand new Emacs
user.

   If you are already familiar with Emacs, you’ll be able to skim this
guide for the code examples.

=================

* Menu:

* Cleaning out your configuration directories::
* Cloning the repository::


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Cleaning out your configuration directories,  Next: Cloning the repository,  Up: Initial setup

4.1.1 Cleaning out your configuration directories
-------------------------------------------------

First, we need to make sure we are starting with a clean slate.

   If you are starting from scratch, but have started Emacs already, you
probably already have generated some amount of configuration files.  For
more information: *note Init File: (emacs)Init File, or on the web: Init
File
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html).
If you’re on Windows, also see *note Windows HOME: (emacs)Windows HOME,
or on the web: Windows HOME
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Windows-HOME.html).

   You must decide if you wish to remove them or rename them to
something else.

   If you aren’t starting from scratch, then you probably have some
configuration already working and you want to add or use some of the
configuration found in _Crafted Emacs_.  You probably have to adapt and
rewrite parts of your configuration to work with _Crafted Emacs_.

   Wherever you decide to put your Emacs configuration will be known as
‘user-emacs-directory’ for the rest of this guide.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Cloning the repository,  Prev: Cleaning out your configuration directories,  Up: Initial setup

4.1.2 Cloning the repository
----------------------------

To use _Crafted Emacs_, you will need to download the repository.  It is
up to you where you clone to.  If you are not sure where to clone to,
you can use your home directory.

     # N.B. As this is still a beta release, use the craftedv2beta branch
     git clone https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs -b craftedv2beta

   For the rest of this guide, the location where you cloned _Crafted
Emacs_ to will be known as ‘crafted-emacs-home’.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Bootstrapping Crafted Emacs,  Next: Crafted Emacs Modules,  Prev: Initial setup,  Up: Getting Started

4.2 Bootstrapping Crafted Emacs
===============================

After cloning the crafted-emacs repository, we need to let Emacs know
how to load _Crafted Emacs_.

* Menu:

* Early Emacs Initialization::
* Emacs Initialization::


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Early Emacs Initialization,  Next: Emacs Initialization,  Up: Bootstrapping Crafted Emacs

4.2.1 Early Emacs Initialization
--------------------------------

The Emacs startup process has several steps, more than what will be
discussed here.  We will briefly cover the ‘early-init.el’ file which
Emacs allows user to affect some configuration options which occur
before Emacs draws the initial frame (often known as the "window" in a
graphical windowing system).  For more information on ‘early-init.el’
see *note Early Init File: (emacs)Early Init File, or on the web: Early
Init File
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html).

   For our purposes, this is where we initialize the package system.  In
the ‘user-emacs-directory’:

  1. Create a file called ‘early-init.el’
  2. Add this single line of code (which assumes the
     ‘crafted-emacs-home’ is the ‘crafted-emacs’ directory found in your
     home folder):

     (load "~/crafted-emacs/modules/crafted-early-init-config")

   Loading ‘crafted-early-init-config’ will do the following:

   • Setup the ‘package-archives’ list to include the following list of
     package repositories:
       1. *GNU Elpa*: Contains packages which are licensed under the GNU
          GPL (GNU General Public License) and for which the author has
          signed the copyright release to the Free Software Foundation.
          The package archive is maintained by the GNU Emacs
          maintainers.
       2. *Non-GNU Elpa*: Contains packages which are licensed as free
          software (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) and for
          which authors have not signed the copyright release required
          for GNU Elpa.  Authors must however follow a list of rules for
          package submission.  The decision to include a package is left
          to the discretion of the GNU Emacs maintainers.
       3. *MELPA Stable*: MELPA is a community-authored package archive
          with a wide range of packages available.  The stable
          repository contains packages which have a version tag in their
          ‘git’ repository.  These are pulled and built on a regular
          basis as needed when the tag version changes.
       4. *MELPA*: Like MELPA Stable, but packages are based on the
          latest commit in the respective ‘git’ repository (essentially,
          development versions).  These will have version numbers
          similar to this: ‘20210701.839’ which is essentially a date
          stamp when the package was built.
   • Prioritize the list of package repositories to be in the order
     listed above.  This means, we prefer to get packages from GNU Elpa
     first, if not found, then try the next repository down the list,
     finally trying to get the package from MELPA as a last resort.
     This is because _Crafted Emacs_ prefers released versions, if
     available, for all packages installed.
   • Check to make sure the repository cache archives are up-to-date,
     and update if needed.  This check is performed when Emacs is
     starting, and will check to see if the repository cache is older
     than one day.  To check less frequently, set the variable
     ‘crafted-package-update-days’ to a higher value.  To not perform
     the check at all, set the
     ‘crafted-package-perform-stale-archive-check’ variable to ‘nil’.

   Once _Crafted Emacs_ is up and running, no stale checks are made.
Thus, if you run _Crafted Emacs_ for several days without restarting
Emacs, you’ll need to refresh the package repository archive caches
manually.  This is done automatically when running
‘package-list-packages’.

   Outside of special use-cases, this single line of code will be your
entire ‘early-init.el’ file.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Emacs Initialization,  Prev: Early Emacs Initialization,  Up: Bootstrapping Crafted Emacs

4.2.2 Emacs Initialization
--------------------------

The ‘init.el’ file is where most of the work of configuring Emacs will
occur.  Let’s start by creating the ‘init.el’ file in your
‘user-emacs-directory’ and add this code:

     (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
     (when (and custom-file
                (file-exists-p custom-file))
       (load custom-file nil :nomessage))

   Emacs customization is largely a matter of setting the values of
certain variables.  The Emacs customization system will store these in
the file known as the ‘custom-file’ which defaults to your
initialization file, in this case called ‘init.el’.  We’d rather keep
that separate from what we are doing in the ‘init.el’ file as that code
is auto-generated by Emacs.  In a sense, it is a duplication of the work
we will be doing as the values we set programmatically will also be
stored in this file and loaded by the code above.

   For more information on the ‘custom-file’ see *note Saving
Customizations: (emacs)Saving Customizations, or on the web: Saving
Customizations
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Saving-Customizations.html).

   Right below the ‘custom-file’ setup, add the following line (which
assumes the ‘crafted-emacs-home’ is the ‘crafted-emacs’ directory found
in your home folder):

     (load "~/crafted-emacs/modules/crafted-init-config")

   In a rough outline, the ‘crafted-init-config’:
   • sets up the load-path, so code from ‘modules’ and ‘custom-modules’
     can be loaded with ‘require’
   • sets up the ‘info’ system to make this documentation accessible
     from within Emacs’ info buffer
   • ensures all customizations and packages are saved to the
     ‘custom-file’

   These lines define the top of our ‘init.el’, everything else will be
put below.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Crafted Emacs Modules,  Next: Example Configuration,  Prev: Bootstrapping Crafted Emacs,  Up: Getting Started

4.3 Crafted Emacs Modules
=========================

Now that you have bootstrapped _Crafted Emacs_, you can start
configuring Emacs using Crafted Emacs Modules.

* Menu:

* Installing packages::
* Using Crafted Emacs Modules::


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Installing packages,  Next: Using Crafted Emacs Modules,  Up: Crafted Emacs Modules

4.3.1 Installing packages
-------------------------

The standard approach to finding and installing packages is to use the
command ‘M-x list-packages RET’, which will bring up a user interface to
search for packages, review the package details, install, update or
remove package.  For more information: *note Packages: (emacs)Packages.
or on the web: Packages
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Packages.html).

   _Crafted Emacs_ uses the selection facilities for batch-installation
of packages.  This means all packages are added to a list (namely
‘package-selected-packages’) and installed at once.

     ;; Example: Adding "vertico" to the package-selected-packages list (init.el)
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'vertico)

   Additionally, _Crafted Emacs_ provides a few modules which are
bundled together packages for installation.  Each of these modules
simply adds one or more package names to the ‘package-selected-packages’
list, for example:

     ;; snippet of crafted-completion-packages.el:
     ;; not all package names are shown here, the list is shortened for
     ;; brevity.
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'cape)
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'consult)
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'corfu)

   After all packages are selected, they are installed at once with
‘package-install-selected-packages’.  Adding packages after this line
will not install them.

     ;; adding the `:noconfirm' flag will cause all the packages listed in
     ;; the `package-selected-packages' variable to be installed without
     ;; prompting you to confirm that choice.
     (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Using Crafted Emacs Modules,  Prev: Installing packages,  Up: Crafted Emacs Modules

4.3.2 Using Crafted Emacs Modules
---------------------------------

There are two types of modules provided by _Crafted Emacs_.

  1. Package modules (bundle together multiple packages for
     installation)
  2. Configuration modules (configuration for multiple packages)

   The module definitions can be found in ‘crafted-emacs-home/modules/’.

  1. Package definitions: crafted-*-packages

     As explained earlier in the guide, you can add packages manually
     using ‘add-to-list’.  Additionally, _Crafted Emacs_ provides a few
     modules which are bundled together packages for installation.  Each
     of these modules simply adds one or more package names to the
     ‘package-selected-packages’ list.  The bundles of packages are
     split up by logical categories (ui, completion, writing, ...).

     To load one of these bundles, use:

          ;; Add package definitions for completion packages
          ;; to `package-selected-packages'.
          (require 'crafted-completion-packages)

          ;; install selected packages (as shown earlier)
          (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

     To list all the available package bundle available, you can run:

          # In a shell/term from the crafted-emacs-home directory
          ls ./modules/*-packages.el

  2. Configuration: crafted-*-config

     The configuration code provided by _Crafted Emacs_ is to be loaded
     after installing all the packages.

          ;; install selected packages
          (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

          ;; load configuration for the completion packages
          (require 'crafted-completion-config)

     It should be noted that the package definitions are not required to
     use the configuration.  You can manually add a subset of packages,
     the configuration code will only apply the configuration for those
     packages:

          ;; Only select vertico from the crafted-completions module.
          (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'vertico)

          ;; install selected packages
          (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

          ;; Load configuration for the completion packages.
          ;; This will only apply the vertico section of the configuration module.
          (require 'crafted-completion-config)

     To list all the available configuration modules, you can run:

          # In a shell/term from the crafted-emacs-home directory
          ls ./modules/*-config.el


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Example Configuration,  Next: Where to go from here,  Prev: Crafted Emacs Modules,  Up: Getting Started

4.4 Example Configuration
=========================

The example assumes you have cloned crafted-emacs to your home
directory.

   Example ‘early-init.el’:

     ;; Set up package archives
     (load "~/crafted-emacs/modules/crafted-early-init-config")

   Example ‘init.el’:

     ;; Set up custom.el file
     (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
     (when (and custom-file
                (file-exists-p custom-file))
       (load custom-file nil :nomessage))

     ;; Bootstrap crafted-emacs in init.el
     (load "~/crafted-emacs/modules/crafted-init-config")

     ;; Add package definitions for completion packages
     ;; to `package-selected-packages'.
     (require 'crafted-completion-packages)

     ;; Manually select "ef-themes" package
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'ef-themes)

     ;; Install selected packages
     (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

     ;; Load configuration for the completion module
     (require 'crafted-completion-config)

   See the ‘examples’ folder in the git-repo for more examples.

* The ‘custom.el’ file: The customel file.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Using alternate package managers,  Next: The customel file,  Up: Customization

5.1 Using alternate package managers
====================================

Not everyone will prefer to use Emacs’ built-in package manager,
‘package.el’.  Using the package bundle modules from _Crafted Emacs_ is
still possible, however, you will potentially need to iterate over the
‘package-selected-packages’ list to perform the install for your package
manager.  To help with that, the ‘crafted-package-config’ module
provides a variable to set and a function to call.

   Here is an example using ‘straight-use-package’ as the tool to
install packages.  The following lines must be called before any package
is installed (preferable in ‘early-init.el’):

     (load (expand-file-name "modules/crafted-package-config" crafted-emacs-home))

     (setq crafted-package-installer #'straight-use-package)
     (setq crafted-package-installed-predicate #'straight--installed-p)

   In your ‘init.el’ you have to call
‘crafted-package-install-selected-packages’ instead of
‘package-install-selected-packages’, after adding your packages to
‘package-selected-packages’.

   Note: This usage is simple in the sense full recipes are not used
when using _Crafted Emacs_ package bundle modules.  The above
essentially runs code like the following:

     (straight-use-package 'corfu)

   You find a full example crafted-early-init-straight.el
(../examples/crafted-early-init-straight.el) to bootstrap straight in
the examples directory.  Merge it into your ‘early-init.el’ or copy it
to your ‘custom-modules’ folder.  In the later case ‘early-init.el’
would look like this:

     (setq crafted-emacs-home "~/crafted-emacs")

     (load (expand-file-name "custom-modules/crafted-early-init-straight"
                             user-emacs-directory))

   It is not required to use the _Crafted Emacs_ package bundle modules,
you are free to install packages in whatever manner you choose, for
example, using ‘guix-home’ to install Emacs packages from the Guix
Store.  Similarly, using ‘straight’, ‘elpaca’, ‘package-vc’ or others
can be used to install any packages you choose.  Once your packages are
installed, you can then use the _Crafted Emacs_ configuration modules.
These modules have names like ‘crafted-completion-config.el’ for
example.  Add these to your ‘init.el’ *after* installing packages.

Customizable values are defined with the ‘defcustom’ form, and can be
customized using the Easy Customization UI.  A complete discussion is
out of scope for this document, instead see the Emacs Manual for more
information.

   There are several states a value can be in, for our purposes, we will
only consider two of them: the default state and the changed state.
These are not the "official" names but easily convey the concepts of the
variable.  If a value is in the default state, looking in the
Customization UI, the state will be listed as ‘STANDARD’.  Crafted Emacs
takes the approach of using the ‘customize-set-variable’ to update the
values defined with ‘defcustom’.  This will show the values as ‘SET for
current session only’ in the Customization UI.  This is normal since the
values are set each time Emacs starts.  They are technically "SAVED"
since they exist as emacs-lisp code, but since they are not in a
‘custom-set-variables’ form the Customization UI only sees them as "SET
for the current session only".

   A ‘SAVED and set’ value means the Customization code has written the
configuration to disk to be loaded again the next time Emacs starts.
When Emacs saves the configuration from the Customization UI, it simply
adds a couple of forms to the end of your initialization file (typically
‘init.el’), with comments warning about having more than one form with
the same name (see example below).

5.2.2 Loading the ‘custom.el’ file
----------------------------------

This is important because if you, the user, wish to use the
Customization UI to configure Emacs, the customizations will (by
default) be written to the of the ‘init.el’ file in a form called
‘custom-set-variables’ and ‘custom-set-faces’.

   This snippet, added to the top of your ‘init.el’ file sets the name
of the file holding Emacs customizations to be ‘custom.el’ in the same
directory where your ‘init.el’ file resides.  Additionally, the code
checks to see if the file exists, and if so, loads it to take advantage
of the saved configuration therein.

     (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
     (when (and custom-file
                (file-exists-p custom-file))
       (load custom-file nil :nomessage))

   This is an example of what the Emacs customization file might look
like.  The values used here are just examples, you may have many more
values configured than just these.

     (custom-set-variables
      ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
      ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
      ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
      ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
      '(column-number-mode t)
      '(fido-vertical-mode t))
     (custom-set-faces
      ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
      ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
      ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
      ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
      )

7 Modules
*********

Crafted Emacs includes a number of modules to further configure Emacs.
These are intended to be stand-alone in the sense that no module
requires the use of any other module.

   The modules are written to support various themes, for example
mini-buffer selection (completion), writing or ui.  For how to use them,
see the *note Getting Started:: section of the manual.

   While the intent here is to document each module as completely as
reasonably possible, the best-practice is to simply read the code for
the module of interest to understand it best.

   Module documentation may include additional information on related,
popular packages and a small example on how to extend your configuration
while using the same package installation methods as Crafted Emacs.

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Description,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Crafted Emacs Completion Module

7.1.2 Description
-----------------

This module installs and sets up a set of completion-related packages
that work together to achieve a functionality that presents the user
with possible choices to select for all kinds of tasks (picking files,
commands etc.)  based on minimal input.  The choices can be narrowed
ever further by more input.

vertico (https://github.com/minad/vertico)             vertical completion UI based on the default completion system
orderless (https://github.com/oantolin/orderless)      completion style that matches candidates in any order
consult (https://github.com/minad/consult)             provides handy search and select commands
marginalia (https://github.com/minad/marginalia/)      adds info to the minibuffer completions on the side
embark (https://github.com/oantolin/embark/)           provides a set of possible actions for a given context
corfu (https://github.com/minad/corfu/)                provides a completion overlay for completions while typing
cape (https://github.com/minad/cape)                   provides completion at point extensions for corfu

   To explain what the packages do and how they interact, it’s best to
go through them step by step.  For each step, imagine you want to switch
buffers but you neither remember the binding nor the command to do that.
Neither do you remember that the command starts with "switch".  But
you’re sure it was something with buffers, so you hit "M-x" and type
‘buf’.

   A fresh Emacs install would actually be pretty helpful for that
already.  After ‘buf’ you could hit <SPC> or <TAB> to complete to
‘buffer-’ and after trying several continutations without success, you’d
hit <TAB> repeatedly to find out that the command you’re looking for
apparently doesn’t start with "buffer".

 [image src="img/01-vanilla.png" ]


   So you’d try something else, you’d eventually start typing with ‘swi’
and arrive at ‘switch-to-buffer’ rather quickly, via completion.  Emacs
would even show you that there are more than one command that start with
that and present you with the keybindings.

 [image src="img/02-vanilla.png" ]


   That’s OK, but there’s a lot of room for improvement.  That’s where
the packages of these module come in.

   • Vertico

     Vertico is a "minimalistic vertical completion UI" which means that
     when Emacs has a list of candidates that could be completed, it
     offers a list of them in a vertical arrangement.

     If you hit "M-x" and start typing ‘buf’ with vertico installed,
     Emacs shows you a list of all available commands that start with
     "buf".  No need to trigger any completions, it’s just there.

 [image src="img/03-vertico.png" ]


     So this time, you immediately see that no commands with "change" or
     "switch" is in the list and that you have to start with something
     else.  You will probably arrive at the command you’re looking for
     much easier and quicker.

   • Orderless

     Orderless splits your search string and gives you candidates that
     match them regardless of the order.  So with vertico *and*
     orderless installed, it doesn’t matter anymore that you started to
     type ‘buf’.  No need to go back and start with ‘swi’.  With ‘buf’
     <SPC> ‘swi’ you’ll see all commands that contain both components of
     your search.

 [image src="img/04-vertico-orderless.png" ]


     This time, you achieved your goal at the first try.  And Emacs
     still showed you the other commands and their keybindings.  You
     might go and check out what they might do, but wouldn’t it be nice
     if Emacs had already told you?  Time for marginalia.

   • Marginalia

     Marginalia offers helpful information in the minibuffer when
     completions are offered.  So with vertico, orderless and marginalia
     installed, your search for ‘buf’ <SPC> ‘swi’ shows you a list of
     all matching commands with a short info on what they’re doing.

 [image src="img/05-vertico-orderless-marginalia.png" ]


   • Consult

     Consult provides a set of practical commands.  A lot of them are
     replacements for built-in everyday functions
     (https://github.com/minad/consult#available-commands).  (For
     example, try replacing ‘switch-to-buffer’ with ‘consult-buffer’.
     Or replace ‘yank-pop’ with ‘consult-yank-pop’).  However, Crafted
     Emacs leaves most of that untouched.  It’s up to you as the user.
     The module ‘crafted-completion’ sets three consult functions for
     you that fit into the completion behaviour described above.

        • Search-/filtering candidates and bind "C-s" to ‘consult-line’

          Whenever you’re presented with candidates for completions,
          consult provides a filtering search function which updates not
          only the list of candidates in the minibuffer, but also the
          active buffer in a sort of live preview (if applicable).
          Crafted Emacs also replaces ‘isearch’ with ‘consult-line’, so
          that searching through your buffer gives you the same
          behaviour.  Essentially, ‘isearch-backward’ becomes obsolete,
          because consult shows you the forward matches first and next
          the backward matches and you can cycle through them.

 [image src="img/06-consult-line.png" ]


        • Bind "C-r" in the minibuffer to ‘consult-history’

          Whenever you’re presented with candidates for completions in a
          minibuffer, ‘consult’ automatically sorts your most recently
          used candidates to the top.  Also it is searchable like with
          ‘consult-line’.  Inside a minibuffer, you can also hit "C-r"
          to show *only* the candidates you have used before.

 [image src="img/07-consult-history.png" ]


        • Use ‘consult-completion-in-region’ as completion function

          Completion not only comes into effect in the minibuffer, but
          also (depending on other settings – like major mode) within
          your main buffer.  E.g.  completing function or variable names
          etc.

          *Without* ‘consult’, triggering a completion gives you a
          static list of candidates if there is more than one.

 [image src="img/08-completion-without-consult.png" ]


          *With* ‘consult’, the list of candidates is dynamic as you
          type and updates the current selection as a preview in the
          buffer.

 [image src="img/09-completion-with-consult.png" ]


   • Embark

     Embark is very versatile package that does far more than can be
     described here.  We highly recommend to read through the packages
     documentation (https://github.com/oantolin/embark).

     As it’s set up in this module, Embark offers two main features:

        • ‘embark-act’

          The ‘embark-act’ function (bound to "C-.")  offers you a lot
          of possible actions that can be applied to the element of the
          buffer (or minibuffer) in which your cursor is positioned.
          You can think of this as a context menu, similar to what you
          achieve in many user interfaces by right-clicking on
          something.

          But ‘embark-act’ can be used for much more, have a look at the
          video The Many Uses of Embark (https://youtu.be/qk2Is_sC8Lk)
          in the System Crafters Channel.

        • ‘embark-bindings’ & ‘embark-prefix-help-command’

          Crafted Emacs replaces ‘describe-bindings’ and
          ‘prefix-help-command’ with their Embark-alternatives to
          provide a functionality similar to packages like ‘which-key’:
          It shows you available options and commands, but with all the
          goodies provided by the other packages above.

          For one last time, imagine you want so switch buffers and have
          forgotten how.  But this time, you also remember that there
          was a binding for it, probably starting with "C-x".

          You can hit "C-x C-h" to see a list of possible bindings after
          the "C-x" prefix.  But you don’t need to cycle through them,
          you can fuzzy-filter them.  Type "buf" to see only the
          bindings that relate to buffers.

 [image src="img/10-filtered-describe-bindings.png" ]


   • Corfu

     Corfu provides a completion overlay while you are typing in a
     regular buffer.  How these overlays are triggered depends on the
     major mode of the buffer.  This module sets up corfu so that it
     almost always triggers automatically.  Otherwise, try hitting <TAB>
     or by ‘C-M-i’, which are the regular completion at point commands.
     In programming modes, it’s also set up to show documentation if
     possible, so the effect is similar to how other IDEs offer popup
     completions.

 [image src="img/11-corfu-and-doc.png" ]


     Use arrow keys or ‘C-n’ and ‘C-p’ to move the next or previous
     completion in the list.  To read more of the documentation, use
     ‘M-n’ or ‘M-p’ to scroll the documentation overlay.

   • Cape

     A great addition to Corfu is Cape.  Cape provides several
     completion backends for Corfu (see table below).  This module turns
     on ‘cape-dabbrev’ and ‘cape-file’.

     Here are the backends built into Cape and what they’re doing:

‘cape-dabbrev’   Complete word from current buffers
‘cape-file’      Complete file name
‘cape-history’   Complete from Eshell, Comint or minibuffer history
‘cape-keyword’   Complete programming language keyword
‘cape-symbol’    Complete Elisp symbol
‘cape-abbrev’    Complete abbreviation (‘add-global-abbrev’, ‘add-mode-abbrev’)
‘cape-ispell’    Complete word from Ispell dictionary
‘cape-dict’      Complete word from dictionary file
‘cape-line’      Complete entire line from current buffer
‘cape-tex’       Complete unicode char from TeX command, e.g.  ‘\hbar’.
‘cape-sgml’      Complete unicode char from Sgml entity, e.g., ‘&alpha’.
‘cape-rfc1345’   Complete unicode char using RFC 1345 mnemonics.

To use this module, simply require them in your ‘init.el’ at the
appropriate points.

     ;; add crafted-lisp package definitions to selected packages list
     (require 'crafted-lisp-packages)

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Description (1),  Next: Additional packages geiser-*,  Prev: Installation (1),  Up: Crafted Emacs Lisp Module

7.2.2 Description
-----------------

The ‘crafted-lisp’ module provides packages and configuration for
development using various Lisp and Scheme variants.

   • ‘aggressive-indent-mode’ for all Lisp/Scheme modes

     ‘aggressive-indent’ automatically indents code, even while editing
     or moving code around.  aggressive-indent-mode is added to
     ‘lisp-mode-hook’, ‘scheme-mode-hook’ and ‘clojure-mode-hook’.

  1. Common Lisp

     The configuration for Common Lisp features Sylvester the cat’s
     Common Lisp IDE for Emacs (‘sly’).  The ‘sly-editing-mode’ is added
     to the ‘lisp-mode-hook’.

     Sly provides a debugger, inspector, xref, completion, integration
     with ASDF (‘sly-asdf’) and Quicklisp (‘sly-quicklisp’) system
     definition tools.  For ansi-color in the REPL, the package
     ‘sly-repl-ansi-color’ is added.

     The sly extension packages (‘sly-*’) are loaded once the main ‘sly’
     package is loaded.

     To set the Common Lisp implementation, customize the
     ‘inferior-lisp-program’, for example:

          ;; SBCL
          (customize-set-variable 'inferior-lisp-program "/usr/bin/sbcl")

          ;; Using roswell
          (customize-set-variable 'inferior-lisp-program "/usr/bin/ros run")

  2. Clojure

        • Package: ‘cider’

          Cider provides the REPL interface for Clojure in Emacs.

        • Package: ‘clj-refactor’

          Additional refactoring layer built on-top of cider.

          The refactoring keybindings are conflicting with cider by
          default.  Crafted Emacs sets the bindings to ‘C-c r’ by
          default to avoid this conflict.

        • Package: ‘clojure-mode’

          Major mode for Clojure providing syntax highlighting,
          indentation and more.

        • Package: ‘flycheck-clojure’

          Flycheck integration for Clojure linters.

  3. Scheme and Racket

     The Scheme and Racket configuration is entirely based around
     ‘geiser’.

     Geiser provides a modular package for the Scheme family of
     languages including Racket.  There are several modules availble for
     Geiser.  When visiting a scheme file, use ‘M-x run-geiser’ to start
     a REPL.

     If you have installed multiple scheme implementations, you may wish
     to customize the ‘scheme-program-name’ variable.

          ;; Default to guile (already in crafted-lisp-config.el)
          (customize-set-variable 'scheme-program-name "guile")


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Additional packages geiser-*,  Prev: Description (1),  Up: Crafted Emacs Lisp Module

7.2.3 Additional packages: geiser-*
-----------------------------------

‘Crafted Emacs’ pre-installs the geiser interface packages for ‘guile’
and ‘racket’.  Additional geiser packages are usually named in the form
of ‘geiser-<implementation>’, for example:

   • ‘geiser-chez’ for Chez Scheme
   • ‘geiser-chibi’ for Chibi Scheme
   • ‘geiser-chicken’ for Chicken Scheme
   • ‘geiser-gambit’ for Gambit Scheme
   • ‘geiser-gauche’ for Gauche Scheme
   • ‘geiser-kawa’ for GNU Kawa
   • ‘geiser-mit’ for MIT/GNU Scheme
   • ‘stklos’ for STklos

   All of these packages can be installed by adding them to the
‘package-selected-packages’ list before installing all selected
packages:

     ;; Add support for MIT/GNU Scheme
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'geiser-mit)

     ;; install the packages

7.3.1 Installation
------------------

To use this module, simply require them in your ‘init.el’ at the
appropriate points.

     ;; add crafted-org package definitions to selected packages list
     (require 'crafted-org-packages)

     ;; install the packages

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Description (2),  Next: Alternative package org-roam,  Prev: Installation (2),  Up: Crafted Emacs Org Module

7.3.2 Description
-----------------

The ‘crafted-org’ module configures various settings related to
‘org-mode’ as well as installing a few additional related packages to
enhance the experience.

   • ‘org-return-follows-link’: ‘t’

     Pressing ‘<RET>’ while the cursor is over a link will follow the
     link.

   • ‘org-mouse-1-follows-link’: ‘t’

     Pressing ‘<Mouse 1>’ (usually left-click) while the cursor is over
     a link will follow the link.

   • ‘org-link-descriptive’: ‘t’

     Display links in a prettified style, only showing the description
     (if provided).

   • New ‘org-mode-hook’: ‘org-indent-mode’

     Visually indent org-mode files to a given header level.

   • ‘org-hide-emphasis-markers’: ‘t’

     Hides emphasis markers like ‘*bold*’ or ‘=highlighted=’.

   • New ‘org-mode-hook’ and ‘electric-pair-mode-hook’:

     Adding a hook to setting the local
     ‘electric-pair-inhibit-predicate’ value to ignore ‘<’ for
     auto-pairing.  It is attached to both hooks to ensure the predicate
     is set up properly no matter which order the mode-hooks are run.

   • ‘Package: denote’

     Denote is a simple note-taking system for Emacs.  It is entirely
     based around file-naming conventions.

     It works with org, markdown and even basic text (txt) notes.  If
     you have denote installed, *note denote: (denote)Top.

   • ‘Package: org-appear’

     org-appear automatically toggles the appearance of certain elements
     in org-mode when editing in the surrounded region.  This is
     combined with the org-mode setting ‘org-hide-emphasis-markers’ to
     only show markers when editing a region.

     org-appear-mode is added as a hook to ‘org-mode-hook’, enabling
     when visiting an org-mode buffer.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Alternative package org-roam,  Prev: Description (2),  Up: Crafted Emacs Org Module

7.3.3 Alternative package: ‘org-roam’
-------------------------------------

‘org-roam’ is an alternative package option to ‘denote’.  Compared to
denote, it uses a SQLite database to organize notes and links.  It
requires a C compiler as an external dependency to interface with the
database.

   Installation:

     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'org-roam)
     (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

   Example configuration:

     ;; Setting the storage directory:
     ;; Stores org-roam data in a subdirectory under the emacs directory
     (customize-set-variable 'org-roam-directory
                             (expand-file-name "org-roam" user-emacs-directory))

     ;; If you're using a vertical completion framework, you might want a
     ;; more informative completion interface:
     (when (or (bound-and-true-p fido-vertical-mode)
               (bound-and-true-p icomplete-vertical-mode)
               (bound-and-true-p vertico))
       (customize-set-variable 'org-roam-node-display-template
                               (concat "${title:*} "
                                       (propertize "${tags:10}" 'face 'org-tag))))

     ;; suggested keymap based on example from project documentation
     (keymap-global-set "C-c r l" #'org-roam-buffer-toggle)

7.4.2 Description
-----------------

   • ‘Package: keycast’

     Package to show current command and its binding in the modeline or
     in the tab-bar.  By default, activates keycast in the modeline.

   • ‘keycast-remove-tail-elements’: ‘nil’

     By default, keycast-mode removes the elements to the right of the
     modeline.  This may obscure information, so we’ll disable it.

   • ‘keycast-insert-after’: ‘mode-line-misc-info’

     Insert keycast information after ‘mode-line-misc-info’ in the
     ‘mode-line-format’.

8.1 A package (suddenly?) fails to work
=======================================

This scenario happened frequently when upgading to Emacs 28.  It also
may occur in other scenarios as well.  Usually, you will see some
message indicating some symbol is void or some function or command does
not exist.  More often than not, the package maintainer is using a
feature from another package which has not yet been released.  The new
feature is available in the development version of the package however.

   Here are some example issues where things went wrong:
   • Wrong number of arguments error
     (https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/126)
   • Example config doesn’t start
     (https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/132)
   • there are some bugs in package "helpful"
     (https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/140)

   Here are some strategies:

   • Check the code on the package source control page (ie GitHub,
     GitLab or whatever), and make sure the missing code is present on
     the ‘master’ branch.
   • Look at the code associated with the released version (you need to
     look at the most recent tag for this).  If the code is missing
     there, ask the maintainer for a new release.  Often, there are
     years between releases of Emacs packages, but that depends
     completely on the package maintainer.  Some of them release more
     frequently, others only on request.

   Once you have done the steps above, you can choose to take one of
these actions in your configuration:

   • Option 1
        • Use ‘M-x list-packages’ to display the list of packages.
        • Find the package in the list which doesn’t work for you, it
          will have either the _installed_ or _dependency_ status.
        • Press the ‘enter’ key to get more details on the package an
          look near the bottom of the metadata, you should see a line
          with "Other Versions".  Choose the development version - it
          will have a version number that looks like a date and the text
          ‘(melpa)’ next to it.  Press ‘enter’ on this version.
        • Following the step above will take you to the same package but
          from the MELPA repository, and you’ll see a button at the top
          labeled ‘Install’.  Click this button.
        • *Optionally* you can go back to the list of packages, find
          previous installed version, press the letter ’D’ and then the
          letter ’X’ to uninstall that version.
        • Restart Emacs
   • Option 2
        • Edit your ‘early-config.el’ file.
        • Near the bottom, add a line similar to this to pin the
          offending package to MELPA (make sure to replace
          _package-name_ with the name of the actual package):

               (add-to-list 'package-pinned-packages (cons 'package-name "melpa"))

        • Use ‘M-x package-list-packages’ to display the list of
          packages.
        • Find the package in the list, press the letter ’D’ and the
          letter ’X’ to uninstall that package.
        • Restart Emacs, the package should be installed from MELPA thus
          using the development version of the package instead of the
          released version.

   Regardless, always feel free to open an issue here and we can help
you out.  Please be as complete as possible in your description of the
problem.  Include any stack traces Emacs provides (ie start Emacs with:
‘emacs --debug-init’), mention the version number of the package you are
installing, and anything you might have tried but which didn’t work for
you.
