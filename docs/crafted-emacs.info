Crafted Emacs
*************

Hacking one's Emacs configuration is, for some, an ongoing endeavor.
For others, it just needs to work.  Other configuration packages attempt
to be a complete, canned, working configuration, while Crafted attempts
to provide the bare minimum to get you started.  More like a framework
than a complete solution, Crafted Emacs intends to provide a sensible
place to start configuring your Emacs to your needs.

   Defaults provided here were provided by a community of volunteers and
ideally represent sane defaults from which to start.  We expect you to
have different opinions than ours and we expect you to implement those
differences in your own configuration.  Our intent is to provide
something you might find useful to get you started on your own Emacs
configuration journey.

1 Goals
*******

   • No new configuration system, macros, layers etc.  Almost everything
     is straight Emacs Lisp.
   • Provide some pre-configured modules to shorten the time it takes to
     build a nice working configuration.
   • Customizations in the modules we provide should be opt-in by
     default to avoid surprising behavior.
   • Not a turn-key/kitchen sink solution.  There will be holes the user
     must fill.
   • Fewer packages rather than more; we prefer to stay closer to
     built-in functionality as much as possible.
   • Correctness is important, as we expect people who might be new to
     Emacs Lisp to learn from what we have written.  We prefer
     ‘customize-set-variable’ instead of ‘setq’ for ‘defcustom’ values
     as an example.
   • Documentation is thorough, complete, and easy to find.  There is an
     *note info: (crafted-emacs)Top. manual for Crafted Emacs
     distributed with the source.

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Minimal modular configuration,  Next: Prioritize built-in Emacs functionality,  Up: Principles

2.1 Minimal, modular configuration
==================================

The core configuration only sets up Emacs to have a cleaner presentation
with sensible defaults.  It is up to the user to decide which
‘crafted-*’ modules to load.

   Configuration modules depend on other modules and the base
configuration as little as possible.

   The implication is that someone should be able to install or copy
code from a ‘crafted-*’ module into their own configuration _without_
using Crafted Emacs.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Prioritize built-in Emacs functionality,  Next: Can be integrated with a Guix configuration,  Prev: Minimal modular configuration,  Up: Principles

2.2 Prioritize built-in Emacs functionality
===========================================

Where possible, we leverage built-in Emacs functionality instead of
external packages.  When we choose external packages, we prefer those
which are layered on top of existing, built-in, functionality.  For
example:

   • ‘project.el’ instead of ‘Projectile’
   • ‘tab-bar-mode’ instead of ‘Perspective.el’, ‘persp-mode’,
     ‘eyebrowse’, etc
   • ‘eglot’ instead of ‘lsp-mode’ (because ‘eglot’ prioritizes built-in
     functionality in Emacs 28, and is built-in with Emacs 29)


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Can be integrated with a Guix configuration,  Next: Helps you learn Emacs Lisp,  Prev: Prioritize built-in Emacs functionality,  Up: Principles

2.3 Can be integrated with a Guix configuration
===============================================

It should be possible to customize aspects of the Crafted Emacs
configuration inside of a Guix Home configuration so that things like
font sizes, themes, etc can be system-specific.

   It can also use packages installed via the Guix package manager
instead of ‘package.el’.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Helps you learn Emacs Lisp,  Next: Reversible,  Prev: Can be integrated with a Guix configuration,  Up: Principles

2.4 Helps you learn Emacs Lisp
==============================

Instead of providing a higher-level configuration system out of the box
like other Emacs configurations, we follow standard Emacs Lisp patterns
so that you can learn by reading the configuration.  We do our best to
provide clear comments where necessary to help the reader understand our
choices and how the code works.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Reversible,  Prev: Helps you learn Emacs Lisp,  Up: Principles

2.5 Reversible
==============

We recognize not everyone will agree with our decisions, so each
customization should be easily reversible in the users configuration
file.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Why use it?,  Next: Getting Started,  Prev: Principles,  Up: Top

3 Why use it?
*************

Why choose this configuration over _Doom Emacs_, _Spacemacs_, _Prelude_,
or others?

   The goal of this configuration is to make it easier to write your own
Emacs configuration while using pre-made configuration parts maintained
by the community.  Instead of using a monolithic, all-encompassing
approach, we strive to ensure that all parts of this configuration are
optional or interchangeable.

   You should even be able to use the configuration modules we provide
with your own ‘init.el’ file without using this base configuration repo!

4 Getting Started
*****************

Welcome to Crafted Emacs.

   This section provides introductory material for setting up Crafted
Emacs.  We'll approach this from the perspective of the brand new Emacs
user.

   If you are already familiar with Emacs, you'll be able to skim this
guide for the code examples.

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Initial setup,  Next: Bootstrapping Crafted Emacs,  Up: Getting Started

4.1 Initial setup
=================

* Menu:

* Cleaning out your configuration directories::
* Cloning the repository::


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Cleaning out your configuration directories,  Next: Cloning the repository,  Up: Initial setup

4.1.1 Cleaning out your configuration directories
-------------------------------------------------

First, we need to make sure we are starting with a clean slate.

   If you are starting from scratch, but have started Emacs already, you
probably already have generated some amount of configuration files.  For
more information: *note Init File: (emacs)Init File, or on the web: Init
File
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html).
If you're on Windows, also see *note Windows HOME: (emacs)Windows HOME,
or on the web: Windows HOME
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Windows-HOME.html).

   You must decide if you wish to remove them or rename them to
something else.

   If you aren't starting from scratch, then you probably have some
configuration already working and you want to add or use some of the
configuration found in Crafted Emacs.  You probably have to adapt and
rewrite parts of your configuration to work with Crafted Emacs.

   Wherever you decide to put your Emacs configuration will be known as
‘user-emacs-directory’ for the rest of this guide.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Cloning the repository,  Prev: Cleaning out your configuration directories,  Up: Initial setup

4.1.2 Cloning the repository
----------------------------

To use Crafted Emacs, you will need to download the repository.  It is
up to you where you clone to.  If you are not sure where to clone to,
you can use your home directory.

     # N.B. As this is still a release candidate, use the craftedv2RC1 branch
     git clone https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs -b craftedv2RC1

   For the rest of this guide, the location where you cloned Crafted
Emacs to will be known as ‘crafted-emacs-home’.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Bootstrapping Crafted Emacs,  Next: Crafted Emacs Modules,  Prev: Initial setup,  Up: Getting Started

4.2 Bootstrapping Crafted Emacs
===============================

After cloning the crafted-emacs repository, we need to let Emacs know
how to load Crafted Emacs.

* Menu:

* Early Emacs Initialization::
* Emacs Initialization::


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Early Emacs Initialization,  Next: Emacs Initialization,  Up: Bootstrapping Crafted Emacs

4.2.1 Early Emacs Initialization
--------------------------------

The Emacs startup process has several steps, more than what will be
discussed here.  We will briefly cover the ‘early-init.el’ file which
Emacs allows user to affect some configuration options which occur
before Emacs draws the initial frame (often known as the "window" in a
graphical windowing system).  For more information on ‘early-init.el’
see *note Early Init File: (emacs)Early Init File, or on the web: Early
Init File
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html).

   For our purposes, this is where we initialize the package system.  In
the ‘user-emacs-directory’:

  1. Create a file called ‘early-init.el’
  2. Add this single line of code (which assumes the
     ‘crafted-emacs-home’ is the ‘crafted-emacs’ directory found in your
     home folder):

     (load "~/crafted-emacs/modules/crafted-early-init-config")

   Loading ‘crafted-early-init-config’ will do the following:

   • Setup the ‘package-archives’ list to include the following list of
     package repositories:
       1. *GNU Elpa*: Contains packages which are licensed under the GNU
          GPL (GNU General Public License) and for which the author has
          signed the copyright release to the Free Software Foundation.
          The package archive is maintained by the GNU Emacs
          maintainers.
       2. *Non-GNU Elpa*: Contains packages which are licensed as free
          software (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) and for
          which authors have not signed the copyright release required
          for GNU Elpa.  Authors must however follow a list of rules for
          package submission.  The decision to include a package is left
          to the discretion of the GNU Emacs maintainers.
       3. *MELPA Stable*: MELPA is a community-authored package archive
          with a wide range of packages available.  The stable
          repository contains packages which have a version tag in their
          ‘git’ repository.  These are pulled and built on a regular
          basis as needed when the tag version changes.
       4. *MELPA*: Like MELPA Stable, but packages are based on the
          latest commit in the respective ‘git’ repository (essentially,
          development versions).  These will have version numbers
          similar to this: ‘20210701.839’ which is essentially a date
          stamp when the package was built.
   • Prioritize the list of package repositories to be in the order
     listed above.  This means, we prefer to get packages from GNU Elpa
     first, if not found, then try the next repository down the list,
     finally trying to get the package from MELPA as a last resort.
     This is because Crafted Emacs prefers released versions, if
     available, for all packages installed.
   • Check to make sure the repository cache archives are up-to-date,
     and update if needed.  This check is performed when Emacs is
     starting, and will check to see if the repository cache is older
     than one day.  To check less frequently, set the variable
     ‘crafted-package-update-days’ to a higher value.  To not perform
     the check at all, set the
     ‘crafted-package-perform-stale-archive-check’ variable to ‘nil’.

   Once Crafted Emacs is up and running, no stale checks are made.
Thus, if you run Crafted Emacs for several days without restarting
Emacs, you'll need to refresh the package repository archive caches
manually.  This is done automatically when running
‘package-list-packages’.

   Outside of special use-cases, this single line of code will be your
entire ‘early-init.el’ file.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Emacs Initialization,  Prev: Early Emacs Initialization,  Up: Bootstrapping Crafted Emacs

4.2.2 Emacs Initialization
--------------------------

The ‘init.el’ file is where most of the work of configuring Emacs will
occur.  Let's start by creating the ‘init.el’ file in your
‘user-emacs-directory’ and add this code:

     (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
     (when (and custom-file
                (file-exists-p custom-file))
       (load custom-file nil :nomessage))

   Emacs customization is largely a matter of setting the values of
certain variables.  The Emacs customization system will store these in
the file known as the ‘custom-file’ which defaults to your
initialization file, in this case called ‘init.el’.  We'd rather keep
that separate from what we are doing in the ‘init.el’ file as that code
is auto-generated by Emacs.  In a sense, it is a duplication of the work
we will be doing as the values we set programmatically will also be
stored in this file and loaded by the code above.

   For more information on the ‘custom-file’ see *note Saving
Customizations: (emacs)Saving Customizations, or on the web: Saving
Customizations
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Saving-Customizations.html).

   Right below the ‘custom-file’ setup, add the following line (which
assumes the ‘crafted-emacs-home’ is the ‘crafted-emacs’ directory found
in your home folder):

     (load "~/crafted-emacs/modules/crafted-init-config")

   In a rough outline, the ‘crafted-init-config’:
   • sets up the load-path, so code from ‘modules’ and ‘custom-modules’
     can be loaded with ‘require’
   • sets up the ‘info’ system to make this documentation accessible
     from within Emacs' info buffer
   • ensures all customizations and packages are saved to the
     ‘custom-file’

   These lines define the top of our ‘init.el’, everything else will be
put below.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Crafted Emacs Modules,  Next: Example Configuration,  Prev: Bootstrapping Crafted Emacs,  Up: Getting Started

4.3 Crafted Emacs Modules
=========================

Now that you have bootstrapped Crafted Emacs, you can start configuring
Emacs using Crafted Emacs Modules.

* Menu:

* Installing packages::
* Using Crafted Emacs Modules::


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Installing packages,  Next: Using Crafted Emacs Modules,  Up: Crafted Emacs Modules

4.3.1 Installing packages
-------------------------

The standard approach to finding and installing packages is to use the
command ‘M-x list-packages’, which will bring up a user interface to
search for packages, review the package details, install, update or
remove package.  For more information: *note Packages: (emacs)Packages.
or on the web: Packages
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Packages.html).

   Crafted Emacs uses the selection facilities for batch-installation of
packages.  This means all packages are added to a list (namely
‘package-selected-packages’) and installed at once.

     ;; Example: Adding "vertico" to the package-selected-packages list (init.el)
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'vertico)

   Additionally, Crafted Emacs provides a few modules which are bundled
together packages for installation.  Each of these modules simply adds
one or more package names to the ‘package-selected-packages’ list, for
example:

     ;; snippet of crafted-completion-packages.el:
     ;; not all package names are shown here, the list is shortened for
     ;; brevity.
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'cape)
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'consult)
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'corfu)

   After all packages are selected, they are installed at once with
‘package-install-selected-packages’.  Adding packages after this line
will not install them.

     ;; adding the `:noconfirm' flag will cause all the packages listed in
     ;; the `package-selected-packages' variable to be installed without
     ;; prompting you to confirm that choice.
     (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Using Crafted Emacs Modules,  Prev: Installing packages,  Up: Crafted Emacs Modules

4.3.2 Using Crafted Emacs Modules
---------------------------------

There are two types of modules provided by Crafted Emacs.

  1. Package modules (bundle together multiple packages for
     installation)
  2. Configuration modules (configuration for multiple packages)

   The module definitions can be found in ‘crafted-emacs-home/modules/’.

  1. Package definitions: crafted-*-packages

     As explained earlier in the guide, you can add packages manually
     using ‘add-to-list’.  Additionally, Crafted Emacs provides a few
     modules which are bundled together packages for installation.  Each
     of these modules simply adds one or more package names to the
     ‘package-selected-packages’ list.  The bundles of packages are
     split up by logical categories (ui, completion, writing, ...).

     To load one of these bundles, use:

          ;; Add package definitions for completion packages
          ;; to `package-selected-packages'.
          (require 'crafted-completion-packages)

          ;; install selected packages (as shown earlier)
          (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

     To list all the available package bundle available, you can run:

          # In a shell/term from the crafted-emacs-home directory
          ls ./modules/*-packages.el

  2. Configuration: ‘crafted-*-config’

     The configuration code provided by Crafted Emacs is to be loaded
     after installing all the packages.

          ;; install selected packages
          (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

          ;; load configuration for the completion packages
          (require 'crafted-completion-config)

     It should be noted that the package definitions are not required to
     use the configuration.  You can manually add a subset of packages,
     the configuration code will only apply the configuration for those
     packages:

          ;; Only select vertico from the crafted-completions module.
          (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'vertico)

          ;; install selected packages
          (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

          ;; Load configuration for the completion packages.
          ;; This will only apply the vertico section of the configuration module.
          (require 'crafted-completion-config)

     To list all the available configuration modules, you can run:

          # In a shell/term from the crafted-emacs-home directory
          ls ./modules/*-config.el


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Example Configuration,  Next: To save or not to save customizations,  Prev: Crafted Emacs Modules,  Up: Getting Started

4.4 Example Configuration
=========================

The example assumes you have cloned crafted-emacs to your home
directory.

   Example ‘early-init.el’:

     ;; Set up package archives
     (load "~/crafted-emacs/modules/crafted-early-init-config")

   Example ‘init.el’:

     ;; Set up custom.el file
     (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
     (when (and custom-file
                (file-exists-p custom-file))
       (load custom-file nil :nomessage))

     ;; Bootstrap crafted-emacs in init.el
     (load "~/crafted-emacs/modules/crafted-init-config")

     ;; Add package definitions for completion packages
     ;; to `package-selected-packages'.
     (require 'crafted-completion-packages)

     ;; Manually select "ef-themes" package
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'ef-themes)

     ;; Install selected packages
     (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

     ;; Load configuration for the completion module
     (require 'crafted-completion-config)

   See the ‘examples’ folder in the git-repo for more examples.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: To save or not to save customizations,  Next: Where to go from here,  Prev: Example Configuration,  Up: Getting Started

4.5 To save or not to save customizations
=========================================

As described previously, by default Crafted Emacs will save both the
list ‘package-selected-packages’ and all customizations to your
customization file (e.g.  ‘custom.el’).

   You can customize that, too.  To change that behaviour, add one or
both of the following lines to your config:

     (customize-set-variable 'crafted-init-auto-save-customized nil)
     (customize-set-variable 'crafted-init-auto-save-selected-packages nil)

   Whether or not to save these settings to ‘custom.el’ is ultimately a
matter of personal preference.  You probably won't notice a difference
either way.

   In the case of the customizations, we call the function
‘customize-save-customized’ under the hood, which is originally intended
for users who use the Customization UI to try out a bunch of settings
and then decide to conserve the state of their Emacs session.  If you
are such a user, you still have to run ‘customize-save-customized’
manually, because the settings above save the customizations during
_startup_ (via the ‘after-init-hook’).  So it saves the customizations
that are already present in your configuration.

   So why did we turn that on, if it's redundant?  It has to do with
another use of the customization file:

   When you want to leave Crafted Emacs behind, your customization file
will reflect much of your present settings.  In particular, it will
contain the settings that you _haven't_ added to your config yourself,
but that stem from some Crafted Emacs module.  So to leave Crafted Emacs
behind, you don't need to go through the code of the modules and
consider all the ifs and whens we had to consider for different users.
You can see the resulting settings _for you_.  It's all there in you
customization file.  Combine it with the stuff you added yourself and
you have the basis for your new ‘init.el’.

   True, to achieve that, these customizations don't need to be saved
every session.  When you decide to leave Crafted Emacs behind, you can
just run ‘customize-save-customized’ and
‘package--save-selected-packages’ manually and achieve the same result.
But we want to make it as easy as possible for users to leave Crafted
Emacs behind.  And as it doesn't have any noticeable effect on startup
time, we just do it automatically every session and even spare you the
need to run those two functions.

   Still, if you prefer not to save customizations and/or the list of
selected packages during each startup, you can turn that behaviour off
as described above.

   Please note: These variables only affect whether Crafted Emacs will
or won't automatically store anything set by ‘customize-set-variable’,
but that doesn't hinder other processes in Emacs to do so.

5.1 Using alternate package managers
====================================

Not everyone will prefer to use Emacs' built-in package manager,
‘package.el’.  Using the package bundle modules from Crafted Emacs is
still possible, however, you will potentially need to iterate over the
‘package-selected-packages’ list to perform the install for your package
manager.  To help with that, the ‘crafted-package-config’ module
provides a variable to set and a function to call.

   Here is an example using ‘straight-use-package’ as the tool to
install packages.  The following lines must be called before any package
is installed (preferable in ‘early-init.el’):

     (load (expand-file-name "modules/crafted-package-config" crafted-emacs-home))

     (setq crafted-package-installer #'straight-use-package)
     (setq crafted-package-installed-predicate #'straight--installed-p)

   In your ‘init.el’ you have to call
‘crafted-package-install-selected-packages’ instead of
‘package-install-selected-packages’, after adding your packages to
‘package-selected-packages’.

   Note: This usage is simple in the sense full recipes are not used
when using Crafted Emacs package bundle modules.  The above essentially
runs code like the following:

     (straight-use-package 'corfu)

   You find a full example crafted-early-init-straight.el
(../examples/crafted-early-init-straight.el) to bootstrap straight in
the examples directory.  Merge it into your ‘early-init.el’ or copy it
to your ‘custom-modules’ folder.  In the later case ‘early-init.el’
would look like this:

     (setq crafted-emacs-home "~/crafted-emacs")

     (load (expand-file-name "custom-modules/crafted-early-init-straight"
                             user-emacs-directory))

   It is not required to use the Crafted Emacs package bundle modules,
you are free to install packages in whatever manner you choose, for
example, using ‘guix-home’ to install Emacs packages from the Guix
Store.  Similarly, using ‘straight’, ‘elpaca’, ‘package-vc’ or others
can be used to install any packages you choose.  Once your packages are
installed, you can then use the Crafted Emacs configuration modules.
These modules have names like ‘crafted-completion-config.el’ for
example.  Add these to your ‘init.el’ *after* installing packages.

5.2 The ‘custom.el’ file

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Simplified overview of how Emacs Customization works,  Next: Loading the customel file,  Up: The customel file

5.2.1 Simplified overview of how Emacs Customization works
----------------------------------------------------------

Customizable values are defined with the ‘defcustom’ form, and can be
customized using the Easy Customization UI.  A complete discussion is
out of scope for this document, instead see the Emacs Manual for more
information.

   There are several states a value can be in, for our purposes, we will
only consider two of them: the default state and the changed state.
These are not the "official" names but easily convey the concepts of the
variable.  If a value is in the default state, looking in the
Customization UI, the state will be listed as ‘STANDARD’.  Crafted Emacs
takes the approach of using the ‘customize-set-variable’ to update the
values defined with ‘defcustom’.  This will show the values as ‘SET for
current session only’ in the Customization UI.  This is normal since the
values are set each time Emacs starts.  They are technically "SAVED"
since they exist as emacs-lisp code, but since they are not in a
‘custom-set-variables’ form the Customization UI only sees them as "SET
for the current session only".

   A ‘SAVED and set’ value means the Customization code has written the
configuration to disk to be loaded again the next time Emacs starts.
When Emacs saves the configuration from the Customization UI, it simply
adds a couple of forms to the end of your initialization file (typically
‘init.el’), with comments warning about having more than one form with
the same name (see example below).


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Loading the customel file,  Prev: Simplified overview of how Emacs Customization works,  Up: The customel file

5.2.2 Loading the ‘custom.el’ file
----------------------------------

This is important because if you, the user, wish to use the
Customization UI to configure Emacs, the customizations will (by
default) be written to the of the ‘init.el’ file in a form called
‘custom-set-variables’ and ‘custom-set-faces’.

   This snippet, added to the top of your ‘init.el’ file sets the name
of the file holding Emacs customizations to be ‘custom.el’ in the same
directory where your ‘init.el’ file resides.  Additionally, the code
checks to see if the file exists, and if so, loads it to take advantage
of the saved configuration therein.

     (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
     (when (and custom-file
                (file-exists-p custom-file))
       (load custom-file nil :nomessage))

   This is an example of what the Emacs customization file might look
like.  The values used here are just examples, you may have many more
values configured than just these.

     (custom-set-variables
      ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
      ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
      ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
      ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
      '(column-number-mode t)
      '(fido-vertical-mode t))
     (custom-set-faces
      ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
      ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
      ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
      ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
      )

7 Modules
*********

Crafted Emacs includes a number of modules to further configure Emacs.
These are intended to be stand-alone in the sense that no module
requires the use of any other module.

   The modules are written to support various themes, for example
mini-buffer selection (completion), writing or ui.  For how to use them,
see the *note Getting Started:: section of the manual.

   While the intent here is to document each module as completely as
reasonably possible, the best-practice is to simply read the code for
the module of interest to understand it best.

   Module documentation may include additional information on related,
popular packages and a small example on how to extend your configuration
while using the same package installation methods as Crafted Emacs.

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Description,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Crafted Emacs Completion Module

7.1.2 Description
-----------------

This module installs and sets up a set of completion-related packages
that work together to achieve a functionality that presents the user
with possible choices to select for all kinds of tasks (picking files,
commands etc.)  based on minimal input.  The choices can be narrowed
ever further by more input.

vertico (https://github.com/minad/vertico)             vertical completion UI based on the default completion system
orderless (https://github.com/oantolin/orderless)      completion style that matches candidates in any order
consult (https://github.com/minad/consult)             provides handy search and select commands
marginalia (https://github.com/minad/marginalia/)      adds info to the minibuffer completions on the side
embark (https://github.com/oantolin/embark/)           provides a set of possible actions for a given context
corfu (https://github.com/minad/corfu/)                provides a completion overlay for completions while typing
cape (https://github.com/minad/cape)                   provides completion at point extensions for corfu

   To explain what the packages do and how they interact, it's best to
go through them step by step.  For each step, imagine you want to switch
buffers but you neither remember the binding nor the command to do that.
Neither do you remember that the command starts with "switch".  But
you're sure it was something with buffers, so you hit ‘M-x’ and type
‘buf’.

   A fresh Emacs install would actually be pretty helpful for that
already.  After ‘buf’ you could hit <SPC> or <TAB> to complete to
‘buffer-’ and after trying several continuations without success, you'd
hit <TAB> repeatedly to find out that the command you're looking for
apparently doesn't start with "buffer".

 [image src="img/01-vanilla.png" ]


   So you'd try something else, you'd eventually start typing with ‘swi’
and arrive at ‘switch-to-buffer’ rather quickly, via completion.  Emacs
would even show you that there are more than one command that start with
that and present you with the keybindings.

 [image src="img/02-vanilla.png" ]


   That's OK, but there's a lot of room for improvement.  That's where
the packages of these module come in.

  1. Vertico

     Vertico is a "minimalistic vertical completion UI" which means that
     when Emacs has a list of candidates that could be completed, it
     offers a list of them in a vertical arrangement.

     If you hit "M-x" and start typing ‘buf’ with vertico installed,
     Emacs shows you a list of all available commands that start with
     "buf".  No need to trigger any completions, it's just there.

 [image src="img/03-vertico.png" ]


     So this time, you immediately see that no commands with "change" or
     "switch" is in the list and that you have to start with something
     else.  You will probably arrive at the command you're looking for
     much easier and quicker.

  2. Orderless

     Orderless splits your search string and gives you candidates that
     match them regardless of the order.  So with vertico *and*
     orderless installed, it doesn't matter anymore that you started to
     type ‘buf’.  No need to go back and start with ‘swi’.  With ‘buf’
     <SPC> ‘swi’ you'll see all commands that contain both components of
     your search.

 [image src="img/04-vertico-orderless.png" ]


     This time, you achieved your goal at the first try.  And Emacs
     still showed you the other commands and their keybindings.  You
     might go and check out what they might do, but wouldn't it be nice
     if Emacs had already told you?  Time for marginalia.

  3. Marginalia

     Marginalia offers helpful information in the minibuffer when
     completions are offered.  So with vertico, orderless and marginalia
     installed, your search for ‘buf’ <SPC> ‘swi’ shows you a list of
     all matching commands with a short info on what they're doing.

 [image src="img/05-vertico-orderless-marginalia.png" ]


  4. Consult

     Consult provides a set of practical commands.  A lot of them are
     replacements for built-in everyday functions
     (https://github.com/minad/consult#available-commands).  (For
     example, try replacing ‘switch-to-buffer’ with ‘consult-buffer’.
     Or replace ‘yank-pop’ with ‘consult-yank-pop’).  However, Crafted
     Emacs leaves most of that untouched.  It's up to you as the user.
     The module ‘crafted-completion’ sets three consult functions for
     you that fit into the completion behaviour described above.

        • Search-/filtering candidates and bind ‘C-s’ to ‘consult-line’
          Whenever you're presented with candidates for completions,
          consult provides a filtering search function which updates not
          only the list of candidates in the minibuffer, but also the
          active buffer in a sort of live preview (if applicable).
          Crafted Emacs also replaces ‘isearch’ with ‘consult-line’, so
          that searching through your buffer gives you the same
          behaviour.  Essentially, ‘isearch-backward’ becomes obsolete,
          because consult shows you the forward matches first and next
          the backward matches and you can cycle through them.

 [image src="img/06-consult-line.png" ]


        • Bind ‘C-r’ in the minibuffer to ‘consult-history’

          Whenever you're presented with candidates for completions in a
          minibuffer, ‘consult’ automatically sorts your most recently
          used candidates to the top.  Also it is searchable like with
          ‘consult-line’.  Inside a minibuffer, you can also hit "C-r"
          to show *only* the candidates you have used before.

 [image src="img/07-consult-history.png" ]


        • Use ‘consult-completion-in-region’ as completion function

          Completion not only comes into effect in the minibuffer, but
          also (depending on other settings – like major mode) within
          your main buffer.  E.g.  completing function or variable names
          etc.

          *Without* ‘consult’, triggering a completion gives you a
          static list of candidates if there is more than one.

 [image src="img/08-completion-without-consult.png" ]


          *With* ‘consult’, the list of candidates is dynamic as you
          type and updates the current selection as a preview in the
          buffer.

 [image src="img/09-completion-with-consult.png" ]


  5. Embark

     Embark is very versatile package that does far more than can be
     described here.  We highly recommend to read through the packages
     documentation (https://github.com/oantolin/embark).

     As it's set up in this module, Embark offers two main features:

        • ‘embark-act’

          The ‘embark-act’ function (bound to ‘C-.’) offers you a lot of
          possible actions that can be applied to the element of the
          buffer (or minibuffer) in which your cursor is positioned.
          You can think of this as a context menu, similar to what you
          achieve in many user interfaces by right-clicking on
          something.

          But ‘embark-act’ can be used for much more, have a look at the
          video The Many Uses of Embark (https://youtu.be/qk2Is_sC8Lk)
          in the System Crafters Channel.

        • ‘embark-bindings’ & ‘embark-prefix-help-command’

          Crafted Emacs replaces ‘describe-bindings’ and
          ‘prefix-help-command’ with their Embark-alternatives to
          provide a functionality similar to packages like ‘which-key’:
          It shows you available options and commands, but with all the
          goodies provided by the other packages above.

          For one last time, imagine you want so switch buffers and have
          forgotten how.  But this time, you also remember that there
          was a binding for it, probably starting with ‘C-x’.

          You can hit ‘C-x C-h’ to see a list of possible bindings after
          the ‘C-x’ prefix.  But you don't need to cycle through them,
          you can fuzzy-filter them.  Type "buf" to see only the
          bindings that relate to buffers.

 [image src="img/10-filtered-describe-bindings.png" ]


  6. Corfu

     Corfu provides a completion overlay while you are typing in a
     regular buffer.  How these overlays are triggered depends on the
     major mode of the buffer.  This module sets up corfu so that it
     almost always triggers automatically.  Otherwise, try hitting <TAB>
     or by ‘C-M-i’, which are the regular completion at point commands.
     In programming modes, it's also set up to show documentation if
     possible, so the effect is similar to how other IDEs offer popup
     completions.

 [image src="img/11-corfu-and-doc.png" ]


     Use arrow keys or ‘C-n’ and ‘C-p’ to move the next or previous
     completion in the list.  To read more of the documentation, use
     ‘M-n’ or ‘M-p’ to scroll the documentation overlay.

       1. Auto Completion Delay

          Some delay between keypress and auto completion is
          recommended, particularly when pairing Corfu with modules from
          ‘crafted-ide’.  ‘crafted-completion’ sticks with the Corfu
          default of 0.2, but this is configurable via the
          ‘corfu-auto-delay’ custom variable.

          It's worth reading Corfu's recommendations on auto delay
          (https://github.com/minad/corfu#auto-completion) if you plan
          on configuring these parameters.

               ;; Quicker completion with cheaper filtering
               (customize-set-variable 'corfu-auto-delay 0)
               (customize-set-variable 'corfu-echo-delay 0.25)
               (customize-set-variable 'completion-styles '(basic))

  7. Cape

     A great addition to Corfu is Cape.  Cape provides several
     completion backends for Corfu (see table below).  This module turns
     on ‘cape-dabbrev’ and ‘cape-file’.

     Here are the backends built into Cape and what they're doing:

     ‘cape-dabbrev’   Complete word from current buffers
     ‘cape-file’      Complete file name
     ‘cape-history’   Complete from Eshell, Comint or minibuffer history
     ‘cape-keyword’   Complete programming language keyword
     ‘cape-symbol’    Complete Elisp symbol
     ‘cape-abbrev’    Complete abbreviation (‘add-global-abbrev’, ‘add-mode-abbrev’)
     ‘cape-ispell’    Complete word from Ispell dictionary
     ‘cape-dict’      Complete word from dictionary file
     ‘cape-line’      Complete entire line from current buffer
     ‘cape-tex’       Complete unicode char from TeX command, e.g.  ‘\hbar’.
     ‘cape-sgml’      Complete unicode char from Sgml entity, e.g., ‘&alpha’.
     ‘cape-rfc1345’   Complete unicode char using RFC 1345 mnemonics.

-----------------

The ‘crafted-defaults’ module provides a variety of sensible settings
that are commonly held to be universally useful for Emacs users.

   These defaults have been grouped into loose categories.  However,
most of them make sense on their own.  So feel free to pick and choose.

   To make this cherry-picking easier, the following documentation
presents each setting with the default we chose (usually in the format
"variable : value"), followed by instructions on how to _change_ the
setting if you _don't_ want to use the default.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Buffers,  Next: Completion,  Prev: Description (1),  Up: Crafted Emacs Defaults Module

7.2.3 Buffers
-------------

   • ‘global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers’ : ‘t’

     Automatically update buffers not backed by files (e.g.  a directory
     listing in dired) if they are changed outside Emacs (e.g.  by
     version control or a file manager).

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers nil)

   • ‘global-auto-revert-mode’

     Activate a global minor mode to revert any buffer when it changes
     either on disk or via another process (see above).  Affects file
     buffers, too.

     To turn this off, add this code to your config:

          (global-auto-revert-mode -1)

   • ‘dired-dwim-target’ : ‘t’

     When dired shows two directories in separate dired buffers and you
     use copy or move commands in one of them, dired will assume the
     other directory as target directory.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'dired-dwim-target nil)

   • ‘dired-auto-revert-buffer’ : ‘t’

     When revisiting a directory, automatically update dired buffers.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'dired-auto-revert-buffer nil)

   • ‘eshell-scroll-to-bottom-on-input’ : ‘this’

     In eshell buffers, scroll to the bottom on input, but only in the
     selected window.

     You can change this in your config by setting it to ‘all’ (for all
     windows) or to ‘nil’ to turn it off altogether, either by using the
     Customization UI or by adding code like this:

          (customize-set-variable 'eshell-scroll-to-bottom-on-input nil)

   • ‘switch-to-buffer-in-dedicated-window’ : ‘pop’

     Pop up dedicated buffers in a different window.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'switch-to-buffer-in-dedicated-window nil)

     See the documentation for ‘switch-to-buffer-in-dedicated-window’
     for more options.

   • ‘switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions’ : ‘t’

     Treat manual buffer switching (C-x b for example) the same as
     programmatic buffer switching.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions nil)

   • use ibuffer to list buffers

     Prefer the more full-featured built-in ibuffer for managing
     buffers.

     You can change this back to the Emacs default by adding this code
     to your config:

          (keymap-global-set "<remap> <list-buffers>" #'list-buffers)

   • ‘ibuffer-movement-cycle’ : ‘nil’

     When using ibuffer, turn off cycling forward and backward.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'ibuffer-movement-cycle t)

   • ‘ibuffer-old-time’ : 24

     In ibuffer, consider buffers "old" after 24 hours.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding code like this to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'ibuffer-old-time 72)

7.2.4 Completion
----------------

   • ‘fido-vertical-mode’, ‘icomplete-vertical-mode’ or ‘icomplete-mode’

     Turn on the best completion-mode available:

        • In Emacs 28 or later, turn on ‘fido-vertical-mode’.
        • In earlier versions, if the additional package
          ‘icomplete-vertical’ is installed, turn on
          ‘icomplete-vertical-mode’.
        • Otherwise, turn on ‘icomplete-mode’.

     You can change this by turning off the respective mode in your
     config, e.g.  like this:

          (fido-vertical-mode -1)

     Note:
        • To install ‘icomplete-vertical’, add the following code to the
          packages phase of your config:

          (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'icomplete-vertical)

        • If you also use ‘crafted-completion-config’ and have the
          package ‘vertico’ installed, all of these modes will be turned
          off in favour of ‘vertico’.

   The following settings will apply, no matter which completion mode
you use.

   • ‘tab-always-indent’ : ‘complete’

     When hitting the TAB key, Emacs first tries to indent the current
     line.  If it is already indented, it tries to complete the thing at
     point.

     To change this, see the documentation of ‘tab-always-indent’ and
     change it in your config (or the Customizations UI) to reflect the
     desired behaviour, e.g.:

          (customize-set-variable 'tab-always-indent nil)

   • ‘completion-cycle-threshold’ : 3

     When selection completion candidates, setting this variable uses
     cycling, i.e.  completing each of the candidates in turn.  This set
     it up to use cycling as long as there are not more than three
     candidates.

     You can change this by setting it to another number, to ‘t’ for
     cycling always, or to ‘nil’ to turn it off altogether, e.g.  by
     adding this code to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'completion-cycle-threshold 3)

   • ‘completion-category-overrides’ : ‘file’ : ‘partial-completion’

     When completing file names, this settings allows for partial
     completion.  When you type part of the filename Emacs will complete
     the rest if there's no ambiguity, or offer choices if there are
     multiple possible candidates.

     You can revert this setting by adding the following code to your
     config:

          (customize-set-variable 'completion-category-overrides nil)

     Or see the documentation of the variable for alternatives.  You can
     also use it for other category specific completion settings.  For
     example, you can use it to specify a different
     ‘completion-cycle-threshold’ (see above) for files and buffers
     respectively.

   • ‘completions-detailed’ : ‘t’

     Display completions with details (for example in C-h o).

     You can change this by adding the following code to your config:

          (customize-set 'completions-detailed nil)

   • ‘xref-show-definitions-function’ :
     ‘xref-show-definitions-completing-read’

     When using a definition search, and there is more than one
     definition, let the user choose between them by typing in the
     minibuffer with completion.

     You can change this back to Emacs' default by adding the following
     code to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'xref-show-definitions-function
                                  #'xref-show-definitions-buffer)

7.2.5 Editing
-------------

   • ‘delete-selection-mode’

     Typed text replaces the selection if the selection is active,
     pressing delete or backspace deletes the selection.

     To turn this off, add this code to your config:

          (delete-selection-mode -1)

   • ‘indent-tabs-mode’ : ‘nil’

     Only indent using spaces.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'indent-tabs-mode t)

   • ‘kill-do-not-save-duplicates’ : ‘t’

     The ‘kill-ring’ is where Emacs stores the strings to paste later.
     This variable prohibits Emacs from storing duplicates of strings
     which are already on the ‘kill-ring’.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'kill-do-not-save-duplicates nil)

   • ‘bidi-paragraph-direction’ : ‘left-to-right’

     Force directionality of text paragraphs in the buffer.  Crafted
     Emacs sets the default value as ‘left-to-right’, which means for
     buffers which don't have their own value, this one will be used.

     You can change this through the Customization UI or by adding the
     following code in config:

          (customize-set-variable 'bidi-paragraph-direction 'right-to-left)

   • ‘bidi-inhibit-bpa’ : ‘t’

     This setting will inhibit the Bidirectional Parentheses Algorithm,
     which makes redisplay faster.

     You can change the value of this variable by adding this code to
     your config:

          (setq bidi-inhibit-bpa nil)

   • ‘global-so-long-mode’

     Improve performance for files with excessively long lines.

     This minor mode can be turned off in your config by adding:

          (global-so-long-mode -1)

   • Look up dictionary definitions

     Using ‘M-#’ will lookup the word at point in a dictionary.  See the
     documentation of ‘dictionary-lookup-definition’ or the README of
     the built-in ‘dictionary.el’ for details
     (<https://github.com/myrkr/dictionary-el>).  It is set up to show
     dictionary definitions in a side window on the left (see the
     settings for Special Windows below).

     You can unset this keybinding by adding this code to your config:

          (keymap-global-unset "M-#")
          ;; or, for older Emacs versions:
          (global-unset-key "M-#")

   • Flyspell Mode

     If ‘ispell’ is available, this module automatically turns on
     ‘flyspell-mode’ for text-mode and for the comments in prog-mode.

     You can change this by adding this code to your config:

          (remove-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)
          (remove-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'flyspell-prog-mode)

7.2.6 Navigation
----------------

If you have the packages ‘hydra’ and ‘dumb-jump’ installed, this module
adds a hydra definition for dumb-jump and binds it to ‘C-M-y’.

   You can change that binding by adding this code to your config,
replace ‘C-M-y’ by the key stroke you prefer:

     (keymap-set dumb-jump-mode-map "C-M-y" #'dumb-jump-hydra/body)

   You can also use the ‘defhydra’ command to overwrite the hydra.  See
the documentation of the hydra package for details.

7.2.7 Persistence
-----------------

   • ‘recentf-mode’

     This minor mode saves the files you visit as a recent file so you
     can load that file again quickly.  The command ‘recentf-open-files’
     will display a menu of files you opened recently so you can quickly
     open it again.  This mode is added to the ‘after-init-hook’ which
     runs when Emacs is starting but after the initialization files have
     completed running.

     You can change the location of the recent file by adding this to
     your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'recentf-save-file "/some/path/to/recentf")

     You can turn off this behaviour by adding this to your config:

          (remove-hook 'after-init-hook 'recentf-mode)

   • ‘savehist-mode’

     This minor mode saves minibuffer history in the ‘history’ file.
     You can change the location of the file with the Customization UI
     or by adding the following to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'savehist-file
                                  "/path/to/minibuffer/history/file")

     You can turn off this mode by adding this code to your config:

          (savehist-mode -1)

   • ‘bookmark-save-flag’ : 1

     Save bookmarks to file every time you make or delete a bookmark.

     To change this, see the documentation of ‘bookmark-save-flag’ for
     valid values and then add code like this to your config (e.g.  to
     never save bookmarks):

          (customize-set-variable 'bookmark-save-flag nil)

   • ‘winner-mode’

     Enable winner-mode
     (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Window-Convenience.html)
     and provides a set of keybindings that help you navigate through
     multiple windows.

     ‘winner-mode’ is a minor mode that, when activated, allows you to
     revert to a prior windows arrangement.  It provides two functions
     to allow this: ‘winner-undo’ and ‘winner-redo’.  These take you to
     earlier and later windows arrangements respectively.

     To store the keybindings associated with this module, a new keymap
     is created: ‘crafted-windows-key-map’, Additionally, this module
     defines a custom variable, ‘crafted-windows-prefix-key’, which
     allows you to set the prefix key to the keymap.  By default, this
     is set to ‘C-c w’, but you are free to change it.

     To do so, replace ‘C-c w’ with the desired keystrokes in code like
     this in your config:

          (with-eval-after-load 'crafted-defaults-config
            (customize-set-variable 'crafted-windows-prefix-key "C-c w")
            (keymap-global-set crafted-windows-prefix-key 'crafted-windows-key-map))

   Using the default prefix-key, the keybindings defined in this module
are

Key Chord   Function         Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------
C-c w u     winner-undo      Reverts to the previous windows layout
C-c w n     windmove-down    Moves point to window below
C-c w p     windmove-up      Moves point to window above
C-c w b     windmove-left    Moves point to window to the left
C-c w f     windmove-right   Moves point to window to the right

   If you want to change the keybindings, add code like this to your
config:

     (keymap-set 'crafted-windows-key-map "d" 'windmove-down)

   If you want to turn off the mode altogether, add this code to your
config:

     (winner-mode -1)

   • ‘auto-window-vscroll’ : ‘nil’

     Turn off the automatic adjustment of ‘window-vscroll’ to view tall
     lines.  Together with the following four settings, this makes
     scrolling less stuttered.

     To change this, add this code to your config:

          (setq auto-window-vscroll t)

   • ‘fast-but-imprecise-scrolling’ : ‘t’

     Improves scrolling speed by not rendering fontification updates
     unless the text would actually be visible in the buffer.  Applies
     when scrolling very fast.  Together with other settings in this
     section, this makes scrolling less stuttered.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding this code to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'fast-but-imprecise-scrolling nil)

   • ‘scroll-conservatively’ : 101

     If the point moves off the screen, redisplay will scroll by up to
     101 lines to bring it back on the screen again.  If that is not
     enough, redisplay will recenter.  Together with other settings in
     this section, this makes scrolling less stuttered.

     Change this setting either by finding it in the Customization UI or
     by adding code like this to your config, setting the number to the
     desired amount.  Setting it to 0 will make it recenter all the
     time:

          (customize-set-variable 'scroll-conservatively 0)

   • ‘scroll-margin’ : 0

     Turn off automatic scrolling when the point comes near to the
     bottom or top of the window.  Together with other settings in this
     section, this makes scrolling less stuttered.

     To change this, set ‘scroll-margin’ to a number of lines within
     which automatic scrolling should be triggered, e.g.

          (customize-set-variable 'scroll-margin 5)

   • ‘scroll-preserve-screen-position’ : ‘t’

     When scrolling, move the point to keep its screen position
     unchanged.  Together with other settings in this section, this
     makes scrolling less stuttered.

     Change this value in the Customization UI or by adding this code to
     config:

          (customize-set-variable 'scroll-preserve-screen-position nil)

   • ‘Man-notify-method’ : ‘aggressive’

     Open man pages in their own window, and switch to that window to
     facilitate reading and closing the man page.

     You can change this back to Emacs' default by adding this code to
     your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'Man-notify-method 'friendly)

     See the documentation of ‘Man-notify-method’ for other valid
     values.

   • ‘ediff-window-setup-function’ : ‘ediff-setup-windows-plain’

     When using Ediff, keep the control panel in the same frame.

     You can change this back to Emacs' default by adding this code to
     your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'ediff-window-setup-function
                                  'ediff-setup-windows-default)

     See the documentation of ‘ediff-window-setup-function’ for details.

   • Special windows - ‘display-buffer-alist’

     Define rules how Emacs opens some special windows.

     ‘*Completions*’
          If two windows are open, use not the current one, but the
          other one.  If only one window is open, open a new one.  If
          the new window is created by a horizontal split, Emacs tries
          to limit the window height to 10 lines.
     ‘*Dictionary*’
          In a new window on the left.
     ‘*Help*’
          If two windows are open, use not the current one, but the
          other one.  If only one window is open, open a new one.

     To change this, see the documentation of ‘display-buffer-alist’.

-------------------

   • ‘load-prefer-newer’ : ‘t’

     When both a compiled (.elc or .eln) and an uncompiled (.el) variant
     of a source file is present, load whichever is newest.  This
     prevents puzzling behaviour when you change something in your code
     but unless you recompile, Emacs will load an out-of-date state of
     your code.

     To change this, either find it in the Customization UI or by adding
     this code to your config:

          (customize-set-variable 'load-prefer-newer nil)

   • ‘executable-make-buffer-file-executable-if-script-p’

     When saving a file that starts with the shebang (‘#!’), make that
     file executable.

     To change this, add the following code to your config:

          (remove-hook 'after-save-hook
                       'executable-make-buffer-file-executable-if-script-p)

   • ‘repeat-mode’

     If available (beginning with Emacs 28), turn on repeat mode to
     allow certain keys to repeat on the last keystroke.

     For example, ‘C-x [’ to page backward, after pressing this
     keystroke once, pressing repeated ‘[’ keys will continue paging
     backward.

     ‘repeat-mode’ is exited with the normal ‘C-g’, by movement keys,
     typing, or pressing ESC three times.

     Note that in the case of ‘undo’ (by default bound to ‘C-x u’),
     pressing ‘u’ repeatedly will iterate further undos, but typing ‘C-x
     u’ again will act as an undo of the undo, i.e.  a redo, which is
     handy, but possibly unexpected.

     To change this, add the following code to your config:

          (repeat-mode -1)

7.3.2 Description
-----------------

‘evil-mode’ implements modal editing in the style of ‘vim’ in Emacs.
The ‘crafted-evil’ module adds ‘evil-mode’ alongside configuration to
enhance the experience.

   • Package: ‘evil’

     Introduces the ‘evil-mode’ minor mode that adds vim-like modal
     editing, visual selection and text objects to Emacs.

   • Package: ‘evil-collection’

     vim-like bindings for modes not covered by the ‘evil’ package.
     Automatically initialized for all common modes (see
     ‘evil-collection-mode-list’).

   • Package: ‘evil-nerd-commenter’

     Allow easy commenting of code for many different file types.  Is
     enabled with the default keybindings.

   • Package: ‘undo-tree’

     This package is only installed for Emacs 28 or older.  With Emacs
     29 onwards, ‘undo-redo’ is used instead.  Both systems provide
     vim-like undo functionality and are selected for ‘evil-undo-system’
     depending on the version of Emacs.

   • ‘evil-want-integration’: ‘t’

     Load the ‘evil-integration.el’ file from evil-mode.  Provides
     additional integration for various Emacs modes.

   • ‘evil-want-keybinding’: ‘nil’

     Disable keybinding integration, as it's covered by
     ‘evil-collection’.

   • ‘evil-want-C-i-jump’: ‘nil’

     Disable vim's ‘C-i’ jump.

   • ‘evil-respect-visual-line-mode’: ‘t’

     Respect visual-line-mode when moving around with vim movements.

   • ‘evil-want-C-h-delete’: ‘t’

     Enable a more ergonomic delete with ‘C-h’ rather than having to
     reach for the backspace key.

   • ‘evil-search-module’: ‘evil-search’

     Make the evil search more like vim.

   • new binding: ‘C-g’ → ‘evil-normal-state’

     Make ‘C-g’ revert to normal state.

   • new binding: ‘C-M-u’ → ‘universal-argument’

     Rebind universal-argument to ‘C-M-u’ since ‘C-u’ is a vim binding
     to scroll the buffer.

   • new evil bindings: ‘evil-*-visual-line’

     Changes motion binds of ‘j’ and ‘k’ to use the ‘visual-line’
     functions, even when outside ‘visual-line-mode’ buffers.

   • new function: ‘crafted-evil-vim-muscle-memory’

     Enable some of the default keybindings for evil mode to make the
     experience more like vim (C-i jump, Y-yank-to-eol, fine-undo).
     This function can be called after loading the configuration.

   • new function: ‘crafted-evil-discourage-arrow-keys’

     Replace arrow key functionality with a message to discourage use of
     arrow keys (and use "hjkl" instead).  This function can be called
     after loading the configuration.

   • ‘evil-emacs-state-modes’

     Some modes tend to not play nice with evil.  These modes can be
     added to the ‘evil-emacs-state-modes’ list for which ‘evil-mode’
     will be falling back to Emacs-style keybindings and functionality.

     ‘crafted-evil’ adds ‘custom-mode’, ‘eshell-mode’ and ‘term-mode’.

   • ‘vertico’ - keybindings

     If ‘vertico’ is installed and loaded, (e.g.  by
     ‘crafted-completion-config’), evil bindings for it are proably
     handled by ‘evil-collection’ (see above).  If the latter is _not_
     installed, this module provides three keybindings:

     ‘C-j’   ‘vertico-next’
     ‘C-k’   ‘vertico-previous’
     ‘M-h’   ‘vertico-directory-up’

     To change this, add code like this to you config, replacing ‘C-j’
     with the desired keybinding:

          (keymap-set vertico-map "C-j" 'vertico-next)

   This module includes:

   • Project-based buffer management (ibuffer-project
     (https://github.com/muffinmad/emacs-ibuffer-project))
   • LSP client (Eglot)
   • Next-generation syntax parsing (Tree-Sitter)
   • EditorConfig (https://editorconfig.org) support (editorconfig-emacs
     (https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-emacs)).

  1. Aggressive Indentation

     By default Emacs enables Electric Indent
     (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Indent-Convenience.html),
     a minor mode that automatically indents code after a RET key is
     pressed.  ‘crafted-ide’ adds support for Aggressive Indent
     (https://github.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode), which
     re-indents code as it is typed.  You can enable it for programming
     modes with the following:

          (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'aggressive-indent-mode)

  2. Eglot

     Eglot (https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) is a client for the
     Language Server Protocol (LSP) built into Emacs (>=29).  For it to
     work, you have to have a language server installed for the language
     of your choice.  Usually, these have to be installed through your
     operating system.  See this list
     (https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot#connecting-to-a-server) of
     servers that work with Eglot out of the box.

       1. Automatically start Eglot when visiting language buffers

          It's convenient to add a call to ‘eglot-ensure’ for major
          modes that have an accompanying language server so that Eglot
          automatically initializes when that major mode is activated.
          ‘crafted-ide’ makes a function available that will
          automatically add ‘eglot-ensure’ to all major mode hooks for
          which a language server is installed and detected.  You can
          enable this behavior with the following:

               (require 'crafted-ide-config)
               (crafted-ide-eglot-auto-ensure-all)

  3. Tree-Sitter

     Tree-Sitter support (built-in since Emacs 29) enables Emacs to
     better understand the syntax of your code, thus improving syntax
     highlighting and similar functions.  Usage of Tree-Sitter is
     optional.

     To compile the language grammars on initial startup, a C compiler
     is required.

       1. Configuring Tree-Sitter (Emacs 28 or earlier)

          Call ‘crafted-ide-configure-tree-sitter’ after requiring
          ‘crafted-ide-config’.


               (require 'crafted-ide-config)
               (crafted-ide-configure-tree-sitter)


          A new function ‘crafted-tree-sitter-load’ will be available to
          install language grammars.


               (crafted-tree-sitter-load 'python)


       2. Configuring Tree-Sitter (Emacs 29 or later)

          Call ‘crafted-ide-configure-tree-sitter’ after requiring
          ‘crafted-ide-config’.  This will install all known language
          grammars for Tree-Sitter.  To opt-out of one or more language
          grammars, pass them as a list to
          ‘crafted-ide-configure-tree-sitter’.  This can be useful if a
          language grammar doesn't build on your setup or you generally
          do not want a language grammar included as you would otherwise
          be re-prompted to install new grammars on every Emacs startup.


               (require 'crafted-ide-config)

               ;; install all language grammars
               (crafted-ide-configure-tree-sitter)

               ;; install all language grammars, except protobuf
               (crafted-ide-configure-tree-sitter '(protobuf))


       3. Combobulate

          Another use is the package Combobulate, which uses Tree-Sitter
          to provide a structured movement within your code.
          Combobulate is not installed by this module (it is not yet
          available on (M)ELPA etc.).  But if you have installed it
          manually, it is automatically loaded for programming modes.

          See Combobulate (https://github.com/mickeynp/combobulate) for
          details.

          If you're interested in a more in-depth look at both
          Tree-Stitter and Combobulate, the author of the package has
          written an extensive blog post about it: Combobulate:
          Structured Movement and Editing with Tree-Sitter
          (https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/combobulate-structured-movement-editing-treesitter).

=============================

* Menu:

* Installation: Installation (4).
* Description: Description (4).
* Additional packages geiser-*::


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Installation (4),  Next: Description (4),  Up: Crafted Emacs Lisp Module

7.5.1 Installation
------------------

To use this module, simply require them in your ‘init.el’ at the
appropriate points.

     ;; add crafted-lisp package definitions to selected packages list
     (require 'crafted-lisp-packages)

     ;; install the packages
     (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

     ;; Load crafted-lisp configuration
     (require 'crafted-lisp-config)


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Description (4),  Next: Additional packages geiser-*,  Prev: Installation (4),  Up: Crafted Emacs Lisp Module

7.5.2 Description
-----------------

The ‘crafted-lisp’ module provides packages and configuration for
development using various Lisp and Scheme variants.

   • ‘aggressive-indent-mode’ for all Lisp/Scheme modes

     ‘aggressive-indent’ automatically indents code, even while editing
     or moving code around.  ‘aggressive-indent-mode’ is added to
     ‘lisp-mode-hook’, ‘scheme-mode-hook’ and ‘clojure-mode-hook’.

  1. Common Lisp

     The configuration for Common Lisp features Sylvester the cat’s
     Common Lisp IDE for Emacs (‘sly’).  The ‘sly-editing-mode’ is added
     to the ‘lisp-mode-hook’.

     Sly provides a debugger, inspector, xref, completion, integration
     with ASDF (‘sly-asdf’) and Quicklisp (‘sly-quicklisp’) system
     definition tools.  For ansi-color in the REPL, the package
     ‘sly-repl-ansi-color’ is added.

     The sly extension packages (‘sly-*’) are loaded once the main ‘sly’
     package is loaded.

     To set the Common Lisp implementation, customize the
     ‘inferior-lisp-program’, for example:

          ;; SBCL
          (customize-set-variable 'inferior-lisp-program "/usr/bin/sbcl")

          ;; Using roswell
          (customize-set-variable 'inferior-lisp-program "/usr/bin/ros run")

  2. Clojure

        • Package: ‘cider’

          Cider provides the REPL interface for Clojure in Emacs.

        • Package: ‘clj-refactor’

          Additional refactoring layer built on-top of cider.

          The refactoring keybindings are conflicting with cider by
          default.  Crafted Emacs sets the bindings to ‘C-c r’ by
          default to avoid this conflict.

        • Package: ‘clojure-mode’

          Major mode for Clojure providing syntax highlighting,
          indentation and more.

        • Package: ‘flycheck-clojure’

          Flycheck integration for Clojure linters.

  3. Scheme and Racket

     The Scheme and Racket configuration is entirely based around
     ‘geiser’.

     Geiser provides a modular package for the Scheme family of
     languages including Racket.  There are several modules availble for
     Geiser.  When visiting a scheme file, use ‘M-x run-geiser’ to start
     a REPL.

     If you have installed multiple scheme implementations, you may wish
     to customize the ‘scheme-program-name’ variable.

          ;; Default to guile (already in crafted-lisp-config.el)
          (customize-set-variable 'scheme-program-name "guile")


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Additional packages geiser-*,  Prev: Description (4),  Up: Crafted Emacs Lisp Module

7.5.3 Additional packages: ‘geiser-*’
-------------------------------------

Crafted Emacs pre-installs the geiser interface packages for guile and
racket.  Additional geiser packages are usually named in the form of
‘geiser-<implementation>’, for example:

   • ‘geiser-chez’ for Chez Scheme
   • ‘geiser-chibi’ for Chibi Scheme
   • ‘geiser-chicken’ for Chicken Scheme
   • ‘geiser-gambit’ for Gambit Scheme
   • ‘geiser-gauche’ for Gauche Scheme
   • ‘geiser-kawa’ for GNU Kawa
   • ‘geiser-mit’ for MIT/GNU Scheme
   • ‘stklos’ for STklos

   All of these packages can be installed by adding them to the
‘package-selected-packages’ list before installing all selected
packages:

     ;; Add support for MIT/GNU Scheme
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'geiser-mit)

     ;; install the packages
     (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

* Alternative package org-roam::


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Installation (5),  Next: Description (5),  Up: Crafted Emacs Org Module

7.6.1 Installation
------------------

To use this module, simply require them in your ‘init.el’ at the
appropriate points.

     ;; add crafted-org package definitions to selected packages list
     (require 'crafted-org-packages)

     ;; install the packages
     (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

     (require 'crafted-org-config)


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Description (5),  Next: Alternative package org-roam,  Prev: Installation (5),  Up: Crafted Emacs Org Module

7.6.2 Description
-----------------

The ‘crafted-org’ module configures various settings related to
‘org-mode’ as well as installing a few additional related packages to
enhance the experience.

   • ‘org-return-follows-link’: ‘t’

     Pressing ‘<RET>’ while the cursor is over a link will follow the
     link.

   • ‘org-mouse-1-follows-link’: ‘t’

     Pressing ‘<Mouse 1>’ (usually left-click) while the cursor is over
     a link will follow the link.

   • ‘org-link-descriptive’: ‘t’

     Display links in a prettified style, only showing the description
     (if provided).

   • New ‘org-mode-hook’: ‘org-indent-mode’

     Visually indent org-mode files to a given header level.

   • ‘org-hide-emphasis-markers’: ‘t’

     Hides emphasis markers like ‘*bold*’ or ‘=highlighted=’.

   • New ‘org-mode-hook’ and ‘electric-pair-mode-hook’:

     Adding a hook to setting the local
     ‘electric-pair-inhibit-predicate’ value to ignore ‘<’ for
     auto-pairing.  It is attached to both hooks to ensure the predicate
     is set up properly no matter which order the mode-hooks are run.

   • Package: ‘denote’

     Denote is a simple note-taking system for Emacs.  It is entirely
     based around file-naming conventions.

     It works with org, markdown and even basic text (txt) notes.  If
     you have denote installed, *note denote: (denote)Top.

   • Package: ‘org-appear’

     org-appear automatically toggles the appearance of certain elements
     in org-mode when editing in the surrounded region.  This is
     combined with the org-mode setting ‘org-hide-emphasis-markers’ to
     only show markers when editing a region.

     org-appear-mode is added as a hook to ‘org-mode-hook’, enabling
     when visiting an org-mode buffer.


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Alternative package org-roam,  Prev: Description (5),  Up: Crafted Emacs Org Module

7.6.3 Alternative package: ‘org-roam’
-------------------------------------

‘org-roam’ is an alternative package option to ‘denote’.  Compared to
denote, it uses a SQLite database to organize notes and links.  It
requires a C compiler as an external dependency to interface with the
database.

   Installation:

     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'org-roam)
     (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

   Example configuration:

     ;; Setting the storage directory:
     ;; Stores org-roam data in a subdirectory under the emacs directory
     (customize-set-variable 'org-roam-directory
                             (expand-file-name "org-roam" user-emacs-directory))

     ;; If you're using a vertical completion framework, you might want a
     ;; more informative completion interface:
     (when (or (bound-and-true-p fido-vertical-mode)
               (bound-and-true-p icomplete-vertical-mode)
               (bound-and-true-p vertico))
       (customize-set-variable 'org-roam-node-display-template
                               (concat "${title:*} "
                                       (propertize "${tags:10}" 'face 'org-tag))))

     ;; suggested keymap based on example from project documentation
     (keymap-global-set "C-c r l" #'org-roam-buffer-toggle)
     (keymap-global-set "C-c r f" #'org-roam-node-find)
     (keymap-global-set "C-c r g" #'org-roam-graph)
     (keymap-global-set "C-c r i" #'org-roam-node-insert)

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Description (6),  Prev: Installation (6),  Up: Crafted Emacs OSX Module

7.7.2 Description
-----------------

The ‘crafted-osx’ module provides customizations to make Emacs more
friendly on a Mac.  These largely have to do with keybindings as the Mac
has a few keys different from a Linux or Windows computer.

   We bind Emacs ‘super’ key to ⌘.  This allows the following
keybindings to be set:

Keybinding   Meaning
------------------------------------------------
⌘-W          (upper case W) delete-frame
⌘-}          tab-bar-switch-to-next-tab
⌘-{          tab-bar-switch-to-prev-tab
⌘-t          tab-bar-new-tab
⌘-w          (lower case w) tab-bar-close-tab

   We provide a function to set the frame titlebar transparent.  You
call it in your configuration like this:

     (crafted-osx-transparent-titlebar)

   Note, this must come after loading the module as describe in the
previous section.

   Finally, we add configuration to raise newly created frames by
default.

   • Package: ‘keycast’

     Package to show current command and its binding in the modeline or
     in the tab-bar.  By default, activates keycast in the modeline.

   • ‘keycast-mode-line-remove-tail-elements’: ‘nil’

     By default, keycast-mode removes the elements to the right of the
     modeline.  This may obscure information, so we'll disable it.

   • ‘keycast-mode-line-insert-after’: ‘mode-line-misc-info’

     Insert keycast information after ‘mode-line-misc-info’ in the
     ‘mode-line-format’.

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Description (8),  Prev: Installation (8),  Up: Crafted Emacs Speedbar Module

7.9.2 Description
-----------------

Speedbar is a tree-like view model built-in to Emacs.  It can be used
for viewing file-trees, currently open buffers and more.

   • ‘speedbar-update-flag’: ‘t’

     Update the speedbar view if the directory of the attached frame
     changes.

     This behaviour can be changed temporarily by invoking
     ‘speedbar-toggle-updates’.  Alternatively, in your configuration
     you can set it to ‘nil’:

          (setq-default speedbar-update-flag nil)

   • ‘speedbar-use-images’: ‘nil’

     Speedbar uses small images for directories, files and file-local
     structures, however in many configurations they turn out pixelated
     or don't fit the theme.  Instead, use text versions.

     To set it back to using images, run:

          (setq-default speedbar-use-images t)

   • ‘speedbar-frame-parameters’

     Customizing ‘speedbar-frame-parameters’ sets additional frame
     parameters for speedbar frames.

     Crafted Emacs adds a frame name/title, removes the minibuffer
     status and adds some border and fringe to the frame.

     To reset the frame parameters:

          (customize-set-variable 'speedbar-frame-parameters
                                  ((minibuffer)
                                   (width . 20)
                                   (border-width . 0)
                                   (menu-bar-lines . 0)
                                   (tool-bar-lines . 0)
                                   (unsplittable . t)
                                   (left-fringe . 0)))

   • new keybinding: ‘crafted-speedbar-switch-to-quick-buffers’ (‘b’)

     Temporarily change speedbar into a buffer switching tool,
     displaying the currently open buffers.  Pressing ‘<enter>’ on a
     buffer in the list will switch to that buffer.

     To bind this function to another key:

          (keymap-set speedbar-mode-map
                      "<key>"
                      #'crafted-speedbar-switch-to-quick-buffers)

   • ‘speedbar-add-supported-extension’: new extensions

     Crafted Emacs adds a wide selection of file extensions that support
     tagging to speedbar's tagging system.  This allows speedbar to add
     tags when expanding a file entry with this extension (e.g.
     ‘org-mode’ headings) and make them clickable navigation links.

example, to display first project module and next the recentf-module,
but not the diary module:
     (customize-set-variable '(crafted-startup-projects crafted-startup-recentf))

   • ‘crafted-startup-recentf’ (activated by default)

     If the list ‘recentf-list’ is not empty, the splash screen will
     display the most recent entries of that list as links.  By default,
     the most recent 10 entries in that list are displayed.  You can
     modify this behaviour by setting ‘crafted-startup-recentf-count’ in
     your config, for example:

          (customize-set-variable 'crafted-startup-recentf-count 3)

     See the documentation for ‘recentf-mode’ for details about the
     list.

   • ‘crafted-startup-diary’

     If a diary file exists, today's entries are displayed on the splash
     screen.  See the Section The Diary File
     (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Format-of-Diary-File.html)
     in the Emacs documentation for details.

   • ‘crafted-startup-projects’

     If the file specified in the built-in variable ‘project-list-file’
     exists, the splash screen will display links to the project
     directories of the first 10 projects listed in that file.  You can
     modify the number of links displayed by setting
     ‘crafted-startup-project-count’ in your config, for example:

          (customize-set-variable 'crafted-startup-project-count 3)

-----------------------------

If you want to turn off the splash screen altogether, you can either
choose not to load the module at all.  Or you can set
‘crafted-startup-inhibit-splash’ to non-nil.  This may be useful if you
want to use the check for updates during startup but not the splash
screen.

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Installation (10),  Next: Description (10),  Up: Crafted Emacs UI Module

7.11.1 Installation
-------------------

To use this module, simply require them in your ‘init.el’ at the
appropriate points.

     ;; add crafted-ui package definitions to selected packages list
     (require 'crafted-ui-packages)

     ;; install the packages
     (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

     (require 'crafted-ui-config)


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Description (10),  Prev: Installation (10),  Up: Crafted Emacs UI Module

7.11.2 Description
------------------

The ‘crafted-ui’ module provides a few interface customizations.

   It installs the packages

all-the-icons
     Various icon fonts to be used by Emacs and packages
helpful
     An augmentation for the built-in Emacs help that provides more
     context.
elisp-demos
     Code examples that can be displayed by helpful.

   It further provides custom variables which can be used to turn on
line numbers in certain major modes (i.e.  ‘prog-mode’ and ‘conf-mode’)
while leaving them turned off for others.

  1. Icons with ‘all-the-icons’

      For ‘all-the-icons’ to work, the necessary fonts need to be
     installed on your system.  If you see a "stop"-icon with an
     exclamation mark at the beginning of this paragraph, you're good to
     go.

     If not, you can run ‘M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts’ to download
     the necessary fonts.  On most OSes, they get installed
     automatically by that command.  On Windows however, they are only
     downloaded and must be installed manually.

  2. Line numbers

     If you want to turn on line numbers for some major modes but leave
     them off for others, set ‘crafted-ui-display-line-numbers’ to
     non-nil in your init.el.

          (customize-set-variable 'crafted-ui-display-line-numbers t)

     By default, this turns *on* line numbers for:
        • prog-mode, i.e.  all programming major modes (Elisp, Python, C
          etc.)
        • conf-mode, i.e.  Unix and Windows Conf files and Java
          properties

     By default, it explicitly turns *off* line numbers for:
        • org-mode

     You can change the default behaviour by customizing the variables
     ‘crafted-ui-line-numbers-enabled-modes’ and
     ‘crafted-ui-line-numbers-disabled-modes’ respectively.

     For example:
          ;; turn off line numbers for python-mode, replacing org-mode
          (customize-set-variable 'crafted-ui-line-numbers-disabled-modes
                                  '(python-mode))

          ;; turn on line numbers for markdown-mode, too
          (add-to-list 'crafted-ui-line-numbers-enabled-modes 'markdown mode)

          ;; which is the same as
          (customize-set-variable 'crafted-ui-line-numbers-enabled-modes
                                  '(conf-mode prog-mode markdown-mode))

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Installation (11),  Next: Description (11),  Up: Crafted Emacs Updates Module

7.12.1 Installation
-------------------

To use this module, simply require them in your ‘init.el’ at the
appropriate points.

     ;; No additional packages are installed by this module.

     ;; install the packages
     (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

     ;; Load crafted-updates configuration
     (require 'crafted-updates-config)


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Description (11),  Prev: Installation (11),  Up: Crafted Emacs Updates Module

7.12.2 Description
------------------

The ‘crafted-updates’ module provides functionality to check for updates
of Crafted Emacs.  To do so, it relies on git (https://git-scm.com/).
It will only work if you cloned the Crafted Emacs github repository
(https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs) to your machine.

   If you installed Crafted Emacs by other means, it's probably a good
idea not to load this module, but take care of updates manually.

  1. Usage and Customization

     You can use the functionality provided by this module in three
     ways: on startup, regularly and manually.

       1. On Startup

          This is probably the easiest way.  Just load the module
          ‘crafted-startup-config’ alongside this module in your
          init.el.  The update check will be run during every startup.
          If you also use the startup screen, a notification about
          updates will be shown there.

               (require 'crafted-updates-config)
               (require 'crafted-startup-config)

          If you don't want to use the startup module, you can also run
          ‘crafted-updates-check-for-latest’ in your ‘init.el’.  It will
          show a notification in the mini-buffer (and in ‘*Messages*’).

               (crafted-updates-check-for-latest)

       2. Regularly

          This module provides a minor mode ‘crafted-updates-mode’.
          When active, it will check for updates regularly.

          Activate it in your config, e.g.  in init.el:
               (crafted-updates-mode 1)

          By default, it checks for updates every 24 hours.  You can
          customize this by modifying the variable
          ‘crafted-updates-fetch-interval’.

          For example, if you want to check every 10 hours:
               (customize-set-variable 'crafted-updates-fetch-interval "10 hours")

          You can also specify a specific time:
               (customize-set-variable 'crafted-updates-fetch-interval "01:23pm")

          In fact that variable accepts a variety of strings describing
          intervals or points at time.  See the documentation for the
          function ‘run-at-time’ (e.g.  by using ‘C-h f’) for more
          examples.

       3. Manually

          If you want to manually check for Crafted Emacs updates, run
          ‘M-x crafted-updates-check-for-latest’.

          If _no_ updates are available, you'll see the message "Crafted
          Emacs is up to date!"  in the mini-buffer.

          If updates are available, you'll see "Crafted Emacs updates
          are available!".  Then you can run ‘M-x
          crafted-updates-pull-latest’ to update your installation.  If
          you want to have a look at the changes first, run ‘M-x
          crafted-updates-show-latest’ before pulling the changes in.

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Installation (12),  Next: Description (12),  Up: Crafted Emacs Workspaces Module

7.13.1 Installation
-------------------

To use this module, simply require them in your ‘init.el’ at the
appropriate points.

     ;; add crafted-workspaces package definitions to selected packages list
     (require 'crafted-workspaces-packages)

     ;; install the packages
     (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

     ;; Load crafted-workspaces configuration
     (require 'crafted-workspaces-config)


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Description (12),  Prev: Installation (12),  Up: Crafted Emacs Workspaces Module

7.13.2 Description
------------------

The ‘crafted-workspaces’ module installs and sets up the tabspaces
(https://github.com/mclear-tools/tabspaces) package to provide
workspaces (think of them like tabs in a web browser) for Emacs.

   To open new workspaces, run ‘M-x
tabspaces-switch-or-create-workspace’.

   This module sets it up so that when changing buffers, you don't see
the whole list of currently opened buffers, but only those that belong
to the current workspace.

   Adding a buffer to a workspace is simple: just open it in that
workspaces.  To remove a buffer from a workspace (but leave it open for
other workspaces), look at the commands
‘tabspaces-remove-selected-buffer’ and
‘tabspaces-remove-current-buffer’.

   To set up bindings for commands like that, have a look at keybindings
(https://github.com/mclear-tools/tabspaces#keybindings) suggested by the
package author.

   When you remove a buffer from all opened workspaces, it will still be
open and available from your default workspace.  You can modify that
behaviour by setting the custom variable ‘tabspaces-remove-to-default’
to nil.

   By default the ‘*scratch*’ buffer is accessible from all workspaces.
You can modify which buffers are included by default by changing the
value of ‘tabspaces-include-buffers’.

   See the documentation of the tabspaces package for details and to
explore further options and settings.

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Installation (13),  Next: Description (13),  Up: Crafted Emacs Writing Module

7.14.1 Installation
-------------------

To use this module, simply require them in your ‘init.el’ at the
appropriate points.

     ;; add crafted-writing package definitions to selected packages list
     (require 'crafted-writing-packages)

     ;; install the packages
     (package-install-selected-packages :noconfirm)

     ;; Load crafted-writing configuration
     (require 'crafted-writing-config)


File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: Description (13),  Prev: Installation (13),  Up: Crafted Emacs Writing Module

7.14.2 Description
------------------

The ‘crafted-writing’ module configures various settings related to text
production with markup languages like Markdown or LaTeX.

   It installs and sets up following packages:
   • ‘markdown-mode’
   • ‘pandoc-mode’
   • ‘auctex’ (if LaTeX is installed on your system)
   • ‘auctex-latexmk’ (if ‘latexmk’ is installed on your system)

  1. Whitespace Mode

     This module also provides a configuration for ‘whitespace-mode’,
     which visualizes whitespace characters like spaces and tabs.  This
     is especially useful for major modes with meaningful whitespace,
     like e.g.  Makefiles.

     This module provides the handy function that can be used in your
     configuration to quickly and easily set up whitespace mode, either
     globally or with mode-specific configurations:

       1. Function ‘crafted-writing-configure-whitespace’

            1. Signature

                    (defun crafted-writing-configure-whitespace
                      (use-tabs &optional use-globally &rest enabled-modes)

            2. Parameters

               ‘use-tabs’ (Type: Boolean)
                    Specifies whether to use tabs for indentation.  If
                    true, tabs are used; if false, spaces are used.
               ‘use-globally’ (Type: Boolean, Optional)
                    Determines whether the whitespace configuration
                    should be applied globally or not.  If true, the
                    configuration is applied globally; if ‘nil’, the
                    configuration is applied only to the current buffer.
                    Defaults to ‘nil’ if not specified.
               ‘enabled-modes’ (Type: List, Optional)
                    List of modes to enable the configuration for.  The
                    configuration gets applied to all modes in the list.
                    If not specified, the configuration applies to all
                    modes.

            3. Examples

               To globally enable whitespace-mode, using spaces instead
               of tabs:
                    (crafted-writing-configure-whitespace nil t nil)

               Or to enable whitespace-mode only for Makefiles, using
               tabs:
                    (crafted-writing-configure-whitespace t nil 'makefile-mode)

               *Please Note:* These two uses of the functions overwrite
               each other.  So if you want to have ‘whitespace-mode’
               active globally with spaces, except for Makefiles, where
               you want to use tabs, use this configuration instead:

                    ;; turns on global-whitespace-mode to use spaces instead of tabs
                    (crafted-writing-configure-whitespace nil t)

                    ;; for Makefiles, turn on the buffer-local mode for using tabs instead of
                    ;; spaces.
                    (add-hook 'makefile-mode-hook #'indent-tabs-mode)

               For more information on ‘indent-tabs-mode’, See the info
               node ‘(emacs)Just Spaces’

  2. Optional Package: PDF-Tools

     Another useful package is PDF-Tools
     (https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools), which provides a better
     experience than just docview for rendering PDF files.  It is not
     installed by default, however, because it involves a two-part
     installation process that varies depending on your OS.

       1. Part 1: Installing the Emacs package ‘pdf-tools’

          Installing the front end in Emacs is simple, just use your
          package manager to install the package ‘pdf-tools’, e.g.  by
          putting this in the packages phase of your ‘init.el’ and
          running ‘package-install-selected-packages’ afterwards:

               (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'pdf-tools)

       2. Part 2: Installing the ‘epdfinfo-server’

          PDF-Tools needs a backend to be run against, the
          epdfinfo-server.

          The only OS officially supported by PDF-Tools is GNU/Linux.
          The Emacs package provides an install script that can be run
          from inside emacs:

          Run ‘M-x pdf-tools-install’.

          That will compile the backend for your system.  For many
          GNU/Linux distributions, the script also takes care of
          installing the necessary prerequisites to build it.

          For other OSes and further info, see Installing the epdfinfo
          server
          (https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools#installing-the-epdfinfo-server).

       3. Configuration

          If this module finds ‘pdf-tools’ installed in your Emacs
          setup, it will add a hook to automatically load it when you
          view PDF documents.  It will also adjust the view to fit the
          width of the document.

          For further options, read the documentation of the package, or
          have a look at the Github repo
          (https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools) or the PDF-Tools Wiki
          (https://pdftools.wiki/).

File: crafted-emacs.info,  Node: A package (suddenly?) fails to work,  Up: Troubleshooting

8.1 A package (suddenly?) fails to work
=======================================

This scenario happened frequently when upgading to Emacs 28.  It also
may occur in other scenarios as well.  Usually, you will see some
message indicating some symbol is void or some function or command does
not exist.  More often than not, the package maintainer is using a
feature from another package which has not yet been released.  The new
feature is available in the development version of the package however.

   Here are some example issues where things went wrong:
   • Wrong number of arguments error
     (https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/126)
   • Example config doesn't start
     (https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/132)
   • there are some bugs in package "helpful"
     (https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/issues/140)

   Here are some strategies:

   • Check the code on the package source control page (ie GitHub,
     GitLab or whatever), and make sure the missing code is present on
     the ‘master’ branch.
   • Look at the code associated with the released version (you need to
     look at the most recent tag for this).  If the code is missing
     there, ask the maintainer for a new release.  Often, there are
     years between releases of Emacs packages, but that depends
     completely on the package maintainer.  Some of them release more
     frequently, others only on request.

   Once you have done the steps above, you can choose to take one of
these actions in your configuration:

   • Option 1
        • Use ‘M-x list-packages’ to display the list of packages.
        • Find the package in the list which doesn't work for you, it
          will have either the _installed_ or _dependency_ status.
        • Press the ‘enter’ key to get more details on the package an
          look near the bottom of the metadata, you should see a line
          with "Other Versions".  Choose the development version - it
          will have a version number that looks like a date and the text
          ‘(melpa)’ next to it.  Press ‘enter’ on this version.
        • Following the step above will take you to the same package but
          from the MELPA repository, and you'll see a button at the top
          labeled ‘Install’.  Click this button.
        • *Optionally* you can go back to the list of packages, find
          previous installed version, press the letter 'D' and then the
          letter 'X' to uninstall that version.
        • Restart Emacs
   • Option 2
        • Edit your ‘early-config.el’ file.
        • Near the bottom, add a line similar to this to pin the
          offending package to MELPA (make sure to replace
          _package-name_ with the name of the actual package):

               (add-to-list 'package-pinned-packages (cons 'package-name "melpa"))

        • Use ‘M-x package-list-packages’ to display the list of
          packages.
        • Find the package in the list, press the letter ‘D’ and the
          letter ‘X’ to uninstall that package.
        • Restart Emacs, the package should be installed from MELPA thus
          using the development version of the package instead of the
          released version.

   Regardless, always feel free to open an issue here and we can help
you out.  Please be as complete as possible in your description of the
problem.  Include any stack traces Emacs provides (ie start Emacs with:
‘emacs --debug-init’), mention the version number of the package you are
installing, and anything you might have tried but which didn't work for
you.
